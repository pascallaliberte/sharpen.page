You've heard about how there's a kind of purchase interviews that stands out from the pack.

A kind of interview that, when done properly, dispenses with the confirmation bias and the noise and **gets answers to the questions**:

* What _caused_ my buyers to pull out their credit card and give us money?
* What _initiated_ their search?
* What is my product _really competing with_?
* What were people using before using my product? What were they _switching away from_ and _why was that alternative no longer doing the job?_

**And, more zoomed in:**

* What were the [forces][four-forces] that caused them to act at each point, go forward, hesitate, go back, struggle with something, get back on the tracks?
* For what [jobs][jtbd-intro] did those buyers "hire" my product? What was the delta, the before and after, the enough-is-enough, the aspiration, the [struggling situation][struggle] that urgently needed movement and momentum?

**So that you can:**

* Decide on [which features you can drop][feature-anxiety] from your product or from your marketing;
* Decide the [kind of copy you'll use on your marketing pages](/struggle-first/vs-features-benefits/);
* Decide what to prioritize on the next version of your product;
* Help influence the people on your team about where to go next with the product.
