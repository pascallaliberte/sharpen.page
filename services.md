## [/visualize](/visualize)

This is a consulting call preceded by an email exchange. The focus of the call (the main value to you) will be about consulting you with what I'd do in your situation. Additionally, our discussion will give me the information I need to put together a proposal for further work for you, if that'd be helpful (I won't try to upsell you).

$250, including our back-and-forth over email ahead of the call and the call itself (about an hour). I'll wave the fee if you choose to go with the next package:

## [/stepitup](/stepitup)

For Your Service Business, a monthly retainer to help you create a value-ladder of options you can give your potential clients (a bit like these options I'm listing here). 

Each month, we sharpen your site in one meaningful way, and we sharpen your understanding of your buyers via some research. Plus you get my availability to get answers to your questions, learn what I'm finding on the web, hang out in your Slack.

If you've already got a good idea of the struggle of your buyer and just need one page done, I've got a one-pager option too.
