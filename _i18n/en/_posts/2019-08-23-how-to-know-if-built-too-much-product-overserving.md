A few days ago, I cancelled a HootSuite account before my trial was over. I had signed up so I could schedule some tweets and some posts on LinkedIn while I was away on vacation, so I could publicize new articles. But then I was digging on how I'd automate retweets from [another Twitter account just for sharpen.page][@SharpenPage], noticed Buffer had a free offering that fit my needs, and signed up to Buffer. I liked Buffer, and decided to cancel HootSuite. **Although I noticed HootSuite had a free tier also, Buffer did the job, and HootSuite felt like it did too much**.

HootSuite was too much product for me.

**"Overserving"**. It's a term that comes from Clayton Christensen's work on Disruption Theory. It happens **when you overshoot the buyer's [job-to-be-done][jtbd-intro]**.

[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

The consequence? People choose a smaller option that _just does the job_.

It's a situation that creeps in, unexpected:

**You grow your product**, you listen to feedback from customers, you add features and you grow your monthly recurring revenue accordingly. But then you get signs you might have overserved.

**Or maybe you grow your agency's team**, you take on bigger clients, you add more services under your belt. You add those services on your website. But then you get signs you might have overserved.

## The Two Signs You Might Have Overserved

### Sign #1: People Are Hesitant to Buy

How do people make purchase decisions anyway? We've looked at the [Four Forces of Progress][four-forces], which describes what pushes and pulls a buyer into advancing toward a purchase, or [back to a default position of non-consumption][non-consumption].

[four-forces]: {% post_url 2018-12-06-forces-of-progress-in-purchase-decision %}
[non-consumption]: {% post_url 2018-12-17-universal-competitor %}

Specifically, people have [anxieties (one of the Four Forces)][four-forces] about what you're offering, which makes them hesitant to buy:

* Am I going to have to commit to using this product?
* Is my information going to be secure?
* Are there people I can trust behind this product or service?
* Will this product to the thing I need to get done?
* Will I have to be learning all of those features?

You can tell they're hesitant to buy if you're measuring high bounce rates and few return visits. You can bet they're likely going to hesitate [if you rely too much on your features in your product communication][features].

[features]: {% post_url 2019-02-15-when-a-feature-is-not-a-feature %}

**What to do?** Try re-writing your marketing copy to communicate that you understand their likeliest struggle. Choose  to recount sharp examples of struggles over generalities. [Downplay the features][downplay-features]. Make a long-form pitch page that half-way down offers help on doing the job themselves (without buying anything), and that takes [multiple shots at making them feel you understand their situation][long-pages]. Interview [recent purchasers on their purchase story][purchase-story] to understand what _caused_ them to hire your product or what you offer, their real job-to-be-done, to understand what made them switch from "I'll do it with what I had before" to "I'm hiring this product".

### Sign #2: People Are Cancelling, Switching to Another Product

Just as your customers switched away from something else before switching to your solution, they're switching away from your thing toward some other thing.

If they're cancelling and switching to a small, more modest product, that likely means your product was overserving.

**What to do?** Run a cancellation survey (or, even better, a [one-click email like this one from Baremetrics][cancellation-insights]), which allows the outgoing customer to provide the reason for their cancellation. If they choose "Switching to another product", then follow-up to offer a gift card in exchange for an interview with them, where you'll conduct a [purchase interview][purchase-story], but for the purchase they made of switching to your competitor.

So keep a close eye on not adding too many features, guard against straying away from serving [the job for which people hired your product][jtbd-intro], and you'll stay clear of overserving.

Stay Sharp!
