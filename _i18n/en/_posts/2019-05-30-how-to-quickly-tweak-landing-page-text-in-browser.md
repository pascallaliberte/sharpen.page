**You've been sweating over** the wording of a headline on your landing page and it's been frustrating to go into your WordPress thingy, make a change, click Preview and see how it looks.

Well there's a way to test that tweak right on the page, directly in the browser, super quick.

<div class="drag-to-bookmarks-container">
  <div>
    <a class="drag-to-bookmarks-link" href="javascript:document.querySelector('body').setAttribute('contenteditable', true);">Make Page Editable</a> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>Just drag this link</strong> to your browser's bookmark bar.
  </div>
</div>

And then visit a page and edit like this:

![Clicking the bookmark makes the page editable](/assets/images/posts/2019-05-30-how-to-quickly-tweak-landing-page-text-in-browser-01.gif)
{: .img-zoom }

_**Note: this will only temporarily change the text.** Hit Refresh, and the changes are gone. Copy/paste your new marvel somewhere else, take a screenshot, email it with <key>Command-I</key> or print it out before you hit Refresh!_

## Two More Ways

Here are two other ways to do the same.

**Option 2:** If you're [on Firefox, there's an extension called ContentEditable][firefox-extension] and it adds a cute edit icon to the address bar to edit the page.

[firefox-extension]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/contenteditable/

**Option 3:** Or here's some JavaScript you can execute from your browser's console (right-click, then select _Inspect Element_). In fact the bookmark button above uses this line of code in the `href`:

```js
document.querySelector('body')
.setAttribute('contenteditable', true);
```

Stay Sharp!

_P.S. Be on the lookout for an upcoming article where we'll be tweaking some headings using this quick technique!_
