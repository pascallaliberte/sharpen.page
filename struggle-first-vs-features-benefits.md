title: When Struggle-First Pages Beat "Features and Benefits" Pages

Your site is probably using a "Features and Benefits" page to publicize your product -- the type of page that describes the product instead of describing the [struggle][struggle].

But, maybe that page no longer works for you, and you need to try something else.

## Your Generic "Features and Benefits" Page Doesn't Seem to Work

> I've tried creating a page that talks about my product. I describe the product, show off some features, I show off some benefits, and I even describe the problem it solves. **But... it's not connecting with anyone.**

A "Features and Benefits" page has a structure that looks like _this_:

1. Hero
1. Social Proof
1. **CTA**
1. Features
1. **CTA**
1. Footer
{: .page-structure }

> Yeah, that's the type of page I have. I know it's generic and everybody has a page like that, **so I figured it must be what works.**

Well, it _does_ work, but maybe not in your situation. A "Features and Benefits" page works okay especially when this criteria is met:

### Features and Benefits Pages Work When There's an Established Mindset...

In the article about [The Best Order of Elements For Your Landing Page][best-order], I wrote about this heuristic for using a "Features and Benefits" page layout that starts with a _hero_ section.

[best-order]: {% post_url 2020-04-17-best-order-of-elements-on-landing-page %}

**If your audience has an established mindset** for the product and its need, starting with a Hero describing the product is not a bad idea. Less is more, to the point, nothing wrong here.

I'll give you an example of "established mindset":

You know those live-chat bubbles at the bottom-right of websites you see nowadays? Well, they didn't use to exist. **Before those were a thing**, there was a struggle, and the struggle looked like this:

![Intercom home page from 2015, sporting a Struggle-First style page](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-06-yeah-but-apple-intercom-have-features-benefits-pages-04.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

Intercom was the one that put the live-chat bubbles on the market before there was an established mindset about live chat bubbles.

The struggle people were having? On the left of that image, that was the struggle: a mess of ways to communicate with your customers, not connected to their context within the app.

Intercom had a Struggle-First page when it started because there was no "established mindset" for live-chat bubbles.

But now that Intercom has _created_ the market, **there's an established mindset** about the solution, and now Intercom no longer has to explain the struggle to their visitors. They can have a page that looks like _this_.

![Intercom's home page as of December 2019](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-06-yeah-but-apple-intercom-have-features-benefits-pages-02.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

See what I mean? Established mindset. Do you have it for your product?

If that's the case, it's a safe bet that you'll benefit from a [Struggle-First page](/struggle-first/) for your product or service.

Stay Sharp.
