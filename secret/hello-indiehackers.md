Hi, I'm Pascal Laliberté. Thanks for following the link from my [IndieHackers][ih-profile] page.

[ih-profile]: https://www.indiehackers.com/pascallaliberte

I do Product Sharpening, helping modest online companies sharpen what they have to offer. Also, if you're a freelancer, I can help you sharpen your own service offerings too. **I do this by understanding your buyer, and then by sharpening your pitch pages.** Check out my [list of services](services/) to learn more.

Specifically, if you're a product team and you've hit a point where more features don't equate with more sales, please check out my [**/prioritize**](/prioritize) package. Stop building and building, and start digging into [purchase stories][purchase-story].

Here's how I can help:

## <small>Option #1</small><br>Public Review

If you have post in [#landing-page-feedback on IndieHackers][ih-landing-page-feedback], please [send me a link to your post](mailto:pascal@pascallaliberte.me?Landing+Page+Feedback). If I think I can help, I'll be glad to leave a public comment.

**If you've got the original .sketch or .xd file** of the design, I could record a screencast of some changes I'd propose making and share that on YouTube. I'd be up for that if you're game.

## <small>Option #2</small><br>Custom Work

I offer a [**/visualize**](/visualize) consultation call for CDN$&nbsp;250. A one-hour call preceded by an email exchange. By the end of the call you'll obtain some of my recommendations, some concrete ways to go forward, and a recording of our conversation.

If you'd like me to provide a quote for custom work, we can discuss that too.

**If you'd rather skip the call**, and you'd like to discuss options to work together, here's my email address:
