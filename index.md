I'm {% include avatar.html %} Pascal Laliberté, and **I help software founders like you <mark>get into the minds of your buyers</mark>**.

* <span>&hellip;</span> when your customers continue to cancel, **despite your product's new features**;

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your customers continue to cancel</mark>, despite the new features you're building…
{: .maybe-heading }

You got there by doing the right thing. **You listened to your customers** and built what they asked for. But despite building the stuff people asked, buyers aren't buying like they used to.

You're getting churn. **More churn than normal.** A sustained wave of cancellations, and it's not just because of a market slowdown. Something needs to change _fast_.

You were going to overhaul your product. Change your whole vision, risk it all. But you decided instead to **dig deeper into the minds of your customers**. That's why you're here: to slow down and to do things right.


## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your landing page and your product positioning</mark> aren't working…
{: .maybe-heading }

You've put in some effort, but you're stuck not knowing which `h1` to use, which features to highlight...

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "Should I highlight this feature or this other one? Should I keep it general or should I center on specific use cases?"

</div>

**You did your best to explain what the software does**, why it would be beneficial. Target market, target problem. You've removed everything that wasn't helping, keep things simple and clean. But what's missing?

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "I've followed some of the norms, but it doesn't seem to be _converting_."

</div>


<br>  
I can help you turn these problems around.

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your customer interviews</mark> are hit and miss…
{: .maybe-heading }

You've conducted some customer interviews, and you got some good points, but you just don't feel like you got to the good insights like you hoped.

Maybe your buyers are different than what you originally thought they'd be. You'd like to dig deeper.

You've started talking to your buyers. But you don't think you're getting the whole story. **You want to _understand_ what's going on.** And you no longer know which questions to ask.



## _Maybe it's that_ Your product <mark>just isn't sharp enough</mark>…
{: .maybe-heading }

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "**Our buyers are using the product for purposes that surprise us.** We're getting cancellations, unused features. We thought we knew what problem our product was hired to solve, but we no longer do. We need to stop building and building and **we need to start digging and digging.**"

## What if _This_ Was Your Future:

Let's transport you to <mark>a time in your future when your product is on track</mark>:

* **You've made some new money** and you _know_ why the money happened.
* Visitors to your marketing pages keep telling you **"I felt understood"** and as a result have been signing up, upgrading with confidence, **keeping their subscription going for a longer time**...
* You _have_ what you need to **prioritize the next steps** in your product's development. You can now say you _understand_ your buyer's motivations, you _know_ what's going on.
* You've grown to have a deeper understanding of your buyers because **you heard some insightful purchase stories** from some of your buyers...
* You've upgraded your strategic direction with **a new vocabulary** to describe how your customers need help getting _progress_ on their struggles...
* You've discovered what _causes_ someone to buy your product, **which of the features** is really supporting the _"job"_ your product is being _"hired"_ to do...

That's what's in the books for you, once you **learn to get in the mind of your buyers**. <mark>I can help you with that</mark>.

### _Option #2_<br>Product Coach for 3 weeks

**Over 3 weeks, some part-time availability** to coach you on your product strategy. It'll be helpful if you're already introduced to the Jobs-to-be-done Theory of customer behavior, but we can cover quickly at the start of those 3 weeks.

I'll help:

* Hypothesize on the broader **aspirations (the progress) your customers wish to attain**
* Map out the anxieties they experience **while deliberating a purchase**.
* Review your **landing pages and taglines**
* Review some **interview recordings**
* Determine if your product needs **an overhaul, a tweak, or if it won't end up working** at all

We'll discuss your strategy over async text and screen shares on a page on which you'll be invited and I'll provide a 2-working-day turnaround time on our exchanges over the 3 weeks. No live calls, all async video and text.

### _Option #3_<br>Review of 8 Customer Interviews

**Over 2 weeks, I will provide feedback on 8 customer interview recordings you conducted**. Provide interpretation, highlight things I spot, include thoughts on product strategy. I'll also provide feedback on what to improve for you next customer interviews, so it's best to pick two weeks where you'll have some more interviews you'll be performing.

Additionally, at the end of the two weeks, I'll provide a one-pager summarizing the insights identified from the interviews. Useful for sharing what was learned with other members of the team.

## Instead of...

If you're hesitating, consider the alternatives...

* **What's the impact of another month** with churn, with bounces on your site, with undecided visitors?
* **What if the overhaul you're considering** doesn't change a thing to your sales?
* **What if you were to put the same amout of money into ads**? Would you be better off on your goals?
* **What if you take some investment money**? You know they'll ask you to shorten your runway to be more bold and daring.

Instead of all this...

* You could **start conducting customer interviews** next week. I hope you do!
* You could **double down on applying Jobs-to-be-done theory** so you can have a predictive model of your buyer's deliberations.
* You could try **putting evidence on your landing page that you understand the buyer's struggle**. Make them say "I feel understood!"
* You could try changing your landing page copy to help **reduce anxieties, instead of adding appeal**.
* You could try **changing the words you use in customer interviews**, like asking retroactive questions that activate recall instead of asking for hypotheticals that activate creativity.

If you do any of this, I hope you'll tell me all about it. Just [drop me an email](mailto:pascal@hey.com) to share.

Stay sharp!
