## I help modest online products and service businesses (like your freelancing practice) going through situations like these…

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> **You're running a service business in a field that's on the up and up**. DevOps, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, SwiftUI, plugin development for e-commerce shops, animations, team coaching. **You're getting attention**, but you know your site is saying something way too generic. Services I offer, Contact me. You know that won't do it.

> "I’ve just realized that **the page describing my product doesn’t do it justice**. It focuses too much on the benefits. I know I can make it communicate more sharply **the problem it can help solve for my customers**."

</div>

So how do you move forward? You know that **it starts by getting a good sense of your customers [struggles][struggles]**. You know you want to help your clients get unstuck.

[struggles]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}

## Your customers just want to make <mark>progress</mark>

[Your product, your service, it gets _hired_ into the lives of your customers for a reason][jtbd-intro]. When they're saying _yes_ to your product, they're saying _no_ to something else. Saying _no_ to that other thing was a key moment for them. It took time before they finally pulled the plug.

[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

So what caused that switch from "not this, now now" to "yes, this, now"?

How is your product helping your customers to make some progress?

<mark>What was the job they needed to get done?</mark>

**Are some of your product's features** causing people to think this?

> "Hey, I don't need this feature to get my job done, and that thing is causing me to hesitate. Should I pay attention to this?"

## Just a few key insights are needed

What _causes_ someone to [buy two ebooks at the same time][two-ebooks]? "The price was too high for these ebooks, but I bought them anyway." What's that all about?

[two-ebooks]: {% post_url 2019-03-01-two-ebooks-purchased-together %}

What's going on in the mind of someone who buys a [$450 pair of winter boots][winter-boots]? Is it that he's a millenial or is there something else in his life _causing him to hire these boots?_

[winter-boots]: {% post_url 2019-01-04-expensive-pair-of-boots %}

In both of these stories, there's something that can be learned. Anecdotes from your buyer's purchase stories give you insights **you can't get from seeing stats or asking people why they bought your product**.

You really need the whole purchase story. Because <mark>that purchase is the final decision in a string of many small decisions</mark>.

**That insight you're missing, that deeper understanding you're after?** It's most likely found in knowing the story behind what _caused_ people to pick your product, after all.

## Purchase stories as part of your qualitative research

What's needed to get enough purchase stories to learn something new:

* 5-10 interviews of recent purchasers (no more than 90 days in the past);
* Buyers who hesitated, deliberated before making the purchase;
* 50-60 minutes per call;
* [A way to record the call][recording-setup] and permission from the person you're interviewing;
* An interview technique that [asks the right questions][interview-questions].

[recording-setup]: {% post_url 2019-03-14-how-to-record-buyer-interviews %}
[interview-questions]: {% post_url 2019-03-08-interview-questions-to-ask %}

That's enough to get started.

[There are more articles on the blog](/articles) to learn more about all this, or if you'd like some help, let me tell you a little bit about what I have to offer:

<aside id="contact" class="home-personal-intro" markdown="1">

<h2>About me {% include avatar.html %}</h2>

Hi, my name is [Pascal Laliberté](https://pascallaliberte.me). I can help you sharpen that product or service offering. I'll help you make it more tuned to <mark>help your customer progress on what they're trying to get progress on</mark>, more distinctive, more incisive, by doing this:

1. **Buyer Interviews and Buyer Research** to uncover the [job for which they hired your product][jtbd], what they switched away from, and the [emotional back-and-forth in their decision-making][fourforces]. 5-10 buyer interviews will suffice for most products. Even a single interview is useful for uncovering what happened to land a big B2B contract;
2. and **landing page copywriting** based on that buyer research.
