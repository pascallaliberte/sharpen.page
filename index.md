## Maybe you're going through one of these situations...

<div class="home-situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "**Things aren't selling as much as I'm hoping.** I interviewed some people but nothing really comes out of my research. I'm tempted to change my marketing, but I've tried that before and haven't found an approach that works. **I've been wasting my time and my attention trying to change my marketing approach**, and I'd like to get some help with my research. I know there's something here, but I just can't uncover it."

> "**People are cancelling our service**, and I'd like to stop the spigot if I could! I know what people are switching to, but I don't want to match the competitor, **I just want to know what makes us unique**."

See your situation listed? [Shoot me an email {% include svg/mail.svg.html %}](mailto:pascal@pascallaliberte.me){: .cta-btn } to tell me what you're up against. Would love to hear the specifics. Or [maybe there's an article I wrote](/articles) that can help out.
{: .cta-interstitial }

> "I'm been finally getting enough traffic to do some A/B testing, but **I'm out of my element when trying some A/B testing alterations**. I realize I have to research my recent buyer's to get better insights, **but that seems time-consuming to me**. I'd like to get someone who's good at research to propose some copywriting changes we can implement and test out."

> "It's been a month and a half since we shipped a feature we've spent 5 sprints building. And despite us educating our users about the feature, **the new feature is barely getting used!** Yet, we've heard from our users that this feature was needed. **Something's wrong with the way we're finding features to build**, and we're sure it's because we're jumping to conclusions about what the user wants. Help!"

## You're seeing:

* Bizarre patterns in who's been buying your product
* Features that work more than expected, other features less than expected
* An uptick in cancellations 
* A slowdown in sales
* A surprising success you didn't see coming

## "I admit, I just don't understand some key things about my customers"

You were sure, but now you're no longer so sure...  
You knew, but now you no longer do...

## Your customers just want to make <mark>progress</mark>

[Your product gets _hired_ into the lives of your customers for a reason][jtbd-intro]. When they're saying _yes_ to your product, they're saying _no_ to something else. Saying _no_ to that other thing was a key moment for them. It took time before they finally pulled the plug.

[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

So what caused that switch from "not this, now now" to "yes, this, now"?

How is your product helping your customers to make some progress?

<mark>What was the job they needed to get done?</mark>

**Are some of your product's features** causing people to think this?

> "Hey, I don't need this feature to get my job done, and that thing is causing me to hesitate. Should I pay attention to this?"

## Just a few key insights are needed

What _causes_ someone to [buy two ebooks at the same time][two-ebooks]? "The price was too high for these ebooks, but I bought them anyway." What's that all about?

[two-ebooks]: {% post_url 2019-03-01-two-ebooks-purchased-together %}

What's going on in the mind of someone who buys a [$450 pair of winter boots][winter-boots]? Is it that he's a millenial or is there something else in his life _causing him to hire these boots?_

[winter-boots]: {% post_url 2019-01-04-expensive-pair-of-boots %}

In both of these stories, there's something that can be learned. Anecdotes from your buyer's purchase stories give you insights **you can't get from seeing stats or asking people why they bought your product**.

You really need the whole purchase story. Because <mark>that purchase is the final decision in a string of many small decisions</mark>.

**That insight you're missing, that deeper understanding you're after?** It's most likely found in knowing the story behind what _caused_ people to pick your product, after all.

## Purchase stories as part of your qualitative research

What's needed to get enough purchase stories to learn something new:

* 5-10 interviews of recent purchasers (no more than 90 days in the past);
* Buyers who hesitated, deliberated before making the purchase;
* 50-60 minutes per call;
* [A way to record the call][recording-setup] and permission from the person you're interviewing;
* An interview technique that [asks the right questions][interview-questions].

[recording-setup]: {% post_url 2019-03-14-how-to-record-buyer-interviews %}
[interview-questions]: {% post_url 2019-03-08-interview-questions-to-ask %}

That's enough to get started.

[There are more articles on the blog](/articles) to learn more about all this, or if you'd like some help, let me tell you a little bit about what I have to offer:

---

## What I offer:

I help you sharpen your product, and your understanding of your buyers, by doing this:

* **Buyer Interviews and Buyer Research** to uncover the [job for which they hired your product][jtbd], what they switched away from, and the [emotional back-and-forth in their decision-making][fourforces]. 5-10 buyer interviews will suffice for most products. Even a single interview is useful for uncovering what happened to land a big B2B contract;
* **Copywriting reviews and tweaks** with split-testing (A/B testing);
* **1-on-1 calls** to review your product approach (pricing, features, messaging).
