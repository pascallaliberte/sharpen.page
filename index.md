I'm {% include avatar.html %} Pascal Laliberté, and **I help software founders like you <mark>get into the minds of your buyers</mark>**.

* <span>&hellip;</span> when your buyers aren't responding, **despite your product's new features**;
* <span>&hellip;</span> when your **customer interviews** are hit and miss;
* <span>&hellip;</span> when your **landing page and your product positioning** aren't working;

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your buyers aren't responding</mark>, despite the new features you're building…
{: .maybe-heading }

You got there by doing the right thing. **You listened to your customers** and built what they asked for. But despite building the stuff people asked, buyers aren't buying like they used to.



## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your customer interviews</mark> are hit and miss…
{: .maybe-heading }

You've conducted some customer interviews, and you got some good points, but you just don't feel like you got to the good insights like you hoped.

Maybe your buyers are different than what you originally thought they'd be. You'd like to dig deeper.

You've started talking to your buyers. But you don't think you're getting the whole story. **You want to _understand_ what's going on.** And you no longer know which questions to ask.



## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your landing page and your product positioning</mark> aren't working…
{: .maybe-heading }

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "I've followed some of the norms, but it doesn't seem to be _converting_."

</div>

You've put in some effort, but you're stuck not knowing which `h1` to use. 

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "Should I highlight this feature or this other one? Should I keep it general or should I center on specific use cases?"

</div>

**You did your best to explain what the software does**, why it would be beneficial. Target market, target problem. You've removed everything that wasn't helping, keep things simple and clean. But what's missing?



## _Maybe it's that_ Your product <mark>just isn't sharp enough</mark>…
{: .maybe-heading }

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "**Our buyers are using the product for purposes that surprise us.** We're getting cancellations, unused features. We thought we knew what problem our product was hired to solve, but we no longer do. We need to stop building and building and **we need to start digging and digging.**"

</div>

## Let's Say We're in the Future

You're celebrating that:

* You've upgraded your strategic direction with **a new vocabulary** to describe how your customers need help getting _progress_ on their struggles...
* You've grown to have a **deeper understanding of your buyers** because you heard some insightful purchase stories from some of your buyers...
* You've discovered what _causes_ someone to buy your product, **which of the features** is really supporting the _"job"_ your product is being _"hired"_ to do...
* You can now say you _understand_ your buyer's motivations, you _know_ what's going on, you _have_ what you need to **prioritize the next steps** in your product's development.
* Your marketing pages have clearly been communicating **"we understand what you're going through"** and people are signing up, upgrading with confidence, **keeping their subscription going for a longer time**...

That's what's in the books for you, once you **learn to get in the mind of your buyers**. <mark>Let me help you with that</mark>.
