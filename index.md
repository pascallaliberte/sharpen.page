## <mark>I help technical entrepreneurs</mark><br> get into the minds of their buyers…

* <span>&hellip;</span> when **there's a doubt** about a product idea working;
* <span>&hellip;</span> when the product's **landing page** isn't quite right;
* <span>&hellip;</span> when there's some cancellations and other **changes in buyer behavior**;
* <span>&hellip;</span> when **new features** don't translate to increased sales;
* <span>&hellip;</span> when you no longer know **how to talk to customers** to get to the good insights;
{: .home-situations-summary }

Would you like **help solving these 5 problems**? I can send you a sequence of 5 emails for that.

[Yes, sign me up for those 5 emails](#){: .cta-btn }

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your Industry Is Changing Real Fast</mark> and You Need Your Ear To the Gound
{: .maybe-heading }

Previously, you were concentrating on a generic profile of buyers. But all of a sudden, those kinds of buyers are down (ie. market downturn, competition), but **surprisingly, other kinds of buyers are up**. What's that about? Sharper use cases, new stories. They're buying your thing _despite_ your generic marketing. Time to dig deeper.

You'd like to move fast, but not waste your efforts on running experiments. You've talked to some recent buyers, but something still doesn't add up. **You want to _understand_ what's going on.** And you no longer know which questions to ask.

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your Product Offers Too Much</mark> and Those Features Don't Sell Like You Hoped
{: .maybe-heading }

Cancellations, unused features, tepid sales calls. **Your product _overserves_.**

You got there by doing the right thing. **You listened to your customers** and built what they asked for. But now your mountain of features is creating anxiety for new buyers. They look, they pause, they leave. Too much going on here. They didn't even get to your product, **because it's your home page that drew them away.**

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "**Our buyers are using the product for purposes that surprise us.** We're getting cancellations, unused features. We thought we knew what problem our product was hired to solve, but we no longer do. We need to stop building and building and **we need to start digging and digging.**"

</div>

<mark>Time to get a handle on things.</mark>

[Please send me tips to fix those problems](#){: .cta-btn }  
5 emails, 5 solutions. Then I'll send you a follow-up email in a few weeks to see how you're doing.

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>You're Getting Attention</mark> and What You're Offering Isn't Sharp Enough
{: .maybe-heading }

Something happened and you're starting to be noticed. People _get it_. You get links sent your way, mentions everywhere. But your home page sells something _generic_, something comfortable, safe. It's certainly not producing that "Yes! I feel seen!" response from your visitors.

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "I’ve just realized that **the page describing my product doesn’t do it justice**. It focuses too much on the benefits. I know I can make it communicate more sharply **the problem it can help solve for my customers**. People finding our site should feel like shouting '**I feel understood!**'"

</div>

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>So Far, You Got Lucky</mark>, But For Your Next Idea, Luck Isn't Around
{: .maybe-heading }

You're starting something new, and you don't know if it'll take off like other ideas have. Validation. Confirmation.

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "Can I predict that this idea will work before I start?"

</div>

**I'm serious about my offer**. 5 emails covering these 5 problems: 

1. product idea confidence, 
2. landing page sharpening, 
3. mystery around buyer behaviors, 
4. wasting time building features, and 
5. jitters about talking to customers.

## You've Tried Doing It Yourself

You've done most of it on your own.  
Maybe you read some books, followed a course.  
Maybe you learned from copywriters, watching others.

But now there's a squeaze and you gotta get moving.

## Let's Say We're in the Future

* That marketing page has clearly been communicating **"we understand what you're going through"**...
* You will have discovered what _causes_ someone to buy your product, **which of the features** is really supporting the _"job"_ your product is being _"hired"_ to do...
* Your strategic direction has been upgraded with **a new vocabulary** to describe how your customers need help getting _progress_ on their struggles...
* You're taken by having heard some purchase stories from some of your buyers and that has given you a **deeper understanding of your buyers**...
* You _understand_ your buyer's motivations, you _know_ what's going on, you _have_ what you need to prioritize the next steps in your product's development

That's what's in the books for you, once you learn to get in the mind of your buyers. **Let me help you with that.**

[Okay, Sign me up](#){: .cta-btn }  
5 emails, then I'll follow-up in a few weeks to see how you're doing.
