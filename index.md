<div class="intro" markdown="1">
A service to help you sharpen how you talk about your product, based on the Jobs-To-Be-Done theory of buyer psychology.
</div>

Hi, my name is [Pascal Lalibert√©](https://pascallaliberte.me). I offer this service for helping you sharpen a service or product page, to make it more remarkable (remark-worthy), more tuned to help your customer progress on what they're trying to get progress on, more distinctive, more incisive, and, well, <mark>more sharp</mark>.

## Your situation:

* **You've got an idea for a service or product** you could offer, to package your skills in a way to help more people;
* You find yourself not sure if you're **packaging it right**;
* When asking for feedback, **people suggest you stay more generic**, more universal;
* When **considering going specific and sharp**, you curiously feel a sense of trepidation and that's for you a sign that you're on the right track;
* You read a lot about tactics like filling up some lean canvases, or writing copy that converts, and **all those other tactics look suspicious to you**;
* **You've heard about the Jobs-To-Be-Done Theory** and you'd like to connect with someone else who's into it;
* You want your product or service page to be **standing out, not blending in**. You don't want it to be dull, you want it to be sharp!

## The theory behind the approach...

Much like you, I despise gimmicky, swindle-y, sales-y wording that aims to convert or influence or reign someone in. But thankfully, those are officially bad ideas anyway.

At the core: a service or a product page is there to help someone make progress. Progress on what? Progress on a sticky point, a fuming disappointment, an upsetting bind, a gradual slide, an uncomfortable truth, a grand scheme, an impasse, a point of no return. Yes, your product or service solves not just a pain _point_, **it solves _situations_, <mark>precise situations</mark>**. And that...

### ... is the Jobs-To-Be-Done Theory

That's why I find the Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) theory to be so refreshingly stable and useful as a base for the understanding of the buyer. Much of this service is based on that theory, and a good place to start learning about it is in this video here:

How looking at your service through a JTBD lens differs from other ways of looking at your service.

--

Instead of: Thinking about target markets and typical roles.

Dig for: Situations people are in

--

Instead of: Correlation

Dig for: Causation

-- 

Instead of: Using the business model canvas or a lean canvas or any other canvas

Dig for: the job-to-be-done of every thing you publish or make available, be it your channels, your newsletter, why your suppliers would want to work with you, etc.

## How I can help

Whether you've got a handle on the JTBD theory or not, at the end of our time together:

### You'll leave with more confidence about the shape of your service or product offering page.

Less about: being medium-confidence generalized  
More about: being high-confidence specific

### You'll leave with options and ideas for tweaking, while having a strong sense of what's core.

Less about: having to trust someone else's process completely  
More about: seeing what works and what can change in different layers

### You'll have a way to start small, with what you already have

Less about: Trying to impress or make it big  
More about: Being helpful to those who want progress in situations you understand

### You'll have a toolkit of small, sharp tools, re-usable in many areas

Fluency in the Jobs-To-Be-Done theory, the forces of progress, addressing your internal resistance, visualizing the end of key interactions. Those tools (and more like them) are applicable in more than just creating service or product offering pages, they help with many other creative endeavours. What are the forces of progress for this client who is hesitating about making the step? What am I so convinced of right now, when feeling such internal pushback for this idea I have?

Less about: Tactics that are trendy  
More about: Tools that more universally-applicable

### You'll leave with ideas about the visuals of your site

Less about: Thinking you can't do visual design  
More about: Relying on the words and on your own style
