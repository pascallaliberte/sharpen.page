A service to help you sharpen how you talk about your product, based on the Jobs-To-Be-Done theory of buyer psychology.

In my suburb, we don't get ice cream trucks going on our street that much, but we do get a sharpening truck go by once or twice a year. You hear the bell, everybody rushes to the window, and instead of an ice-cream truck, there's this fellow going around with a sharpening truck. The driver stops for anyone who wants to sharpen all sorts of dull house tools like sheers, knives and axes. Remarkable right?

Hi, my name is [Pascal Lalibert√©](https://pascallaliberte.me). I'm preparing a service to help you sharpen that product or service you've got. I'll help you make it more tuned to <mark>help your customer progress on what they're trying to get progress on</mark>, more distinctive, more incisive, and, well, <mark>more sharp</mark>.

## Your situation:

* **You've got an idea for a product or a service** you could offer, to package your skills in a way to help more people;
* You find yourself not sure if you're **packaging it right or pricing it right**;
* When asking for feedback, **people suggest you stay more generic**, appealing to a broader audience;
* When **considering going specific and sharp**, you curiously feel a sense of trepidation and that's for you a sign that you're on the right track;
* You read a lot about tactics like filling up some lean canvases, or writing copy that converts, and **all those other tactics feel like they're missing something fundamental**;
* **Maybe you've heard about the Jobs-To-Be-Done Theory** and you'd like to connect with someone else who's into it;
* You want your product or service page to be **standing out, not blending in**, at the edge, not in the middle. You don't want it to be dull, you want it to be sharp!

## I can also help <mark>when...</mark>

* You are **putting together a product** and you'd like more confidence on how to price it;
* You have **started to map out the Forces of Progress Diagrams of your offering(s)** and would like some feedback about your choices;
* You have **made a big sale of a service or customized product to a B2B client** and would like to find out the core reason (the job-to-be-done) of the purchase so you can tweak how you approach new clients;
* You have **made a number of sales of a product** and would like to find out the core reason (the job-to-be-done) of the purchase so you can tweak how you market your product and how you package it;
* You are **about to add some features** but you don't know if they'll contribute to buyer anxieties about your product;
* You are **getting more than 10,000 visits to your site** and would like to test out different marketing copy so you can see if you can increase your revenue.

---

## I'll achieve this via these engagements:

* **1-on-1 calls** to review your product approach (pricing, features, messaging)
* **Buyer Interviews and Buyer Research** to uncover the job for which they hired your product, what they switched away from, and the emotional back-and-forth in their decision-making
* **Copywriting reviews and tweaks** with split-testing (A/B testing)
