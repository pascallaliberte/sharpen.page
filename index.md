## Something came up for you...

...and now it's time to <mark>get serious and put something up for sale</mark>.

* Maybe you put together **a first draft of a sales page**, and it's not going to land like you hoped it would.
* Maybe you feel everything is up in the air in our careers, **something's not right, and you need to start innovating**. Something _noteworthy_ that people will talk about.
* Maybe you've been trying to make a product work for a long time. **The product isn't fitting the market.** You've considered changing direction completely, but maybe you're thinking there's still a different option.
* Maybe <mark>you thought that the thing would just sell itself</mark>.

<div markdown="1" class="home-service-offering-summary">

### _Option #2_<br>Group Call For Solo Devs on Sales and Marketing

**Twice a month, join a small group video call with other solo devs** where we'll review your efforts into understanding your buyers, preparing and executing on your marketing, having sales conversations and writing sales copy.

Maybe **you've had a few sales conversations** that you know you could have handled better. Or maybe your **freelancing practice could use a boost**.

Maybe you'd like to have a mix of small products and freelance offerings. Or maybe you're looking for a bit of accountability and **bouncing ideas with some of your peers**.

_**How it will work**: The frequency will be every two weeks, and may be pushed a week from time to time. The calls, neither recorded nor summarized, will be about an hour long. We're aiming for 10 members or less per call. Every participant will have the chance to share a short update each call and then we'll riff on some ideas, simulate sales conversations maybe, foster feedback and personal investment._

    Pascal helped me tremendously to pin down the messaging and site structure of <a href="https://railsreviews.com">railsreviews.com</a>. His systematic method for discovering hidden opportunities and buyer hesitations is one of a kind. With a sharp eye for customers' struggles, his analyses are insightful, actionable, and rewarding. I'm looking forward to collaborating with him again in future projects.

  <p>
    A crucial milestone in a solopreneur’s journey is to put together a website that reflects your mission, your experience and the services you are offering to potential clients. Sure, you can grab a template and slap some text on it, but crafting a unique web presence that reflects who you are, that requires skills. Working with Pascal allowed me to reflect more deeply on my journey, who I want to work with and how I can help my clients. We went on that discovery together, iterated over ideas, and ended up with a final product that effectively introduce visitors to who I am, zoom in on their journey, the progress they want to achieve and how I can help them move forward.
