## <mark>I help online businesses</mark> who find themselves in situations like these…

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "We're getting cancellations, unused features. Our buyers are using the product for purposes that surprise us. We thought we knew what problem our product was hired to solve, but we no longer do. We need to stop building and building and **we need to start digging and digging.**"

> "I’ve just realized that **the page describing my product doesn’t do it justice**. It focuses too much on the benefits. I know I can make it communicate more sharply **the problem it can help solve for my customers**. People finding our site should feel like shouting '**I feel understood!**'"

**Or maybe you're running a service business in a field that's on the up and up.** Maybe you're past creating deliverables and you're more into coaching your clients. Maybe you do very cutom design or animation work and you want to go for the best of the best. Maybe it's a technical field, like in DevOps, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Cloud orchestration, SwiftUI, plugin development for e-commerce shops.

> "I'm in a specialty that I know there's a niche for. And my site is starting to get visited, **but the services I'm advertising are unremarkable**, a little too scattershot, a little too generic. **Better clients, that's what I'm after.** But I know I'm not making the case on what I can do for them."

<div class="home-personal-intro" markdown="1">
**Hi, I'm {% include avatar.html %} Pascal.**

I offer [services](/services) where **I enter the mind of your buyer**, and help you understand their motivations so you can sharpen what you sell; how it's presented, how you think about what you sell, and to know what to build and what to table.
</div>

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your Industry Is Changing Real Fast</mark> and You Need Your Ear To the Gound
{: .maybe-heading }

Previously, you were concentrating on a generic profile of buyers. But all of a sudden, those kinds of buyers are down (ie. market downturn, competition), but **surprisingly, other kinds of buyers are up**. What's that about? Sharper use cases, new stories. They're buying your thing _despite_ your generic marketing. Time to dig deeper.

  {% include adhoc-post-list.html post_ids=page.articles_on_adjusting %}

You'd like to move fast, but not waste your efforts on running experiments. You've talked to some recent buyers, but something still doesn't add up. **You want to [_understand_ what's going on](/understand).**

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>Your Product Offers Too Much</mark> and Those Features Don't Sell Like You Hoped
{: .maybe-heading }

Cancellations, unused features, tepid sales calls. **Your product _overserves_.**

  {% include adhoc-post-list.html post_ids=page.articles_on_overserving %}

You got there by doing the right thing. **You listened to your customers** and built what they asked for. But now your mountain of features is creating anxiety for new buyers. They look, they pause, they leave. Too much going on here. They didn't even get to your product, **because it's your home page that drew them away.**

## _Maybe it's that_ <mark>You're Getting Attention</mark> and What You're Offering Isn't Sharp Enough
{: .maybe-heading }

Something happened and you're starting to be noticed. People _get it_. You get links sent your way, mentions everywhere. But your home page sells something _generic_, something comfortable, safe. It's certainly not producing that "Yes! I feel seen!" response from your visitors.

  {% include adhoc-post-list.html post_ids=page.articles_on_page_sharpening %}

Enough is enough. **Time to sharpen your marketing pages.**

## Imagining When It'll All Be Done

* Those new [purchase stories][purchase-story] you'll have heard will be top of mind, offering you a **deeper understanding of your buyers**...
* That marketing page will scream **"we understand what you're going through"**...
* Your product team will know what _causes_ someone to buy your product, **which of the features** is really supporting the _"job"_ your product is being _"hired"_ to do...
* Your strategic direction will have **a new vocabulary** to describe how your customers need help getting _progress_ on their struggles...

## What I Offer

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">
> "It'll take too long to figure it out if I do it myself, and I don't want to miss the boat. How can we team up?"
</div>


**[/understand](/understand) -- A research boost to focus your product priorities.** When you've got to take a pause and dig into what motivated your buyers to "hire" your product. Maybe you're getting cancellations, or people aren't using the features you've developed, and you're left a little surprised. You can't continue building and building, and need to start questioning a little bit more.

**[/stepitup](/stepitup#details) -- For your service business, a monthly retainer to evolve your site to include a value-ladder of options** (a bit like these options I'm listing here). Each month, we sharpen your site in one meaningful way, and we sharpen your understanding of your buyers via some research. Plus you get my availability to get answers to your questions, learn what I'm finding on the web, hang out in your Slack. If you've already got a good idea of the struggle of your buyer and just need one page done, I've got a one-pager option too.

**[/visualize](/visualize#details) -- A consulting call**. Preceded by an email exchange to learn how I can help, the focus of the call (the main value to you) will be about consulting you on what to do next. Additionally, our discussion will give me the information I need to put together a proposal for further work for you, if that'd be helpful (I won't try to upsell you). CDN$&nbsp;250, including our back-and-forth over email ahead of the call and the call itself (about an hour). I'll wave the fee if you choose to go with one of the above packages.

**[/struggle-first](/struggle-first)** - **Free**, a collection of videos and articles on creating a Struggle-First marketing/landing page for your product or service. The kind of page that your visitor responds to by saying "I feel understood!". Useful when your thing helps a real struggle, but your audience doesn't have an established mindset about the solution yet.

**[/articles](/articles)** - **Free**, my articles are published every Friday. They cover topics from buyer psychology through the lens of Jobs-To-Be-Done, to copywriting and sharpening your products and services. Sign-up below.

**[/your-purchase-story](/your-purchase-story)** - **I pay _you_ USD $60** for you to tell me a recent purchase story. I'm looking for a time you hesitated a lot, purchased it for yourself, and a few other things I'm looking for. I might blog about your story too (names and details removed), but that's basically the deal.

## Since You Were About to Ask...

### How do I go about doing the buyer research, like you do?

It starts with a messy process of understanding the buyer's vocabulary, the options she considers, and mostly, knowing that "doing it myself" is your primary competitor here. What will people do in-house, on their own, or learn how to to build? Go hang out in forums and Slack communities, and listen for the pains and struggles. Then your research might take you to conduct [purchase interviews][purchase-story], a specific technique that retroactively looks at the story of a purchase (of a competitor, of a piece of software to do it themselves, or a hire). What's needed: that the buyer went through a good amount of deliberation before the purchase. Here's a list of [questions you could use during this Purchase Interview][interview-questions].

[purchase-story]: {% post_url 2019-02-08-digging-purchase-story-for-gold %}
[interview-questions]: {% post_url 2019-03-08-interview-questions-to-ask %}

### Do you do all the copywriting, including blog posts?

I only write the copy for the marketing pages of your site. I know of a good writer for your blog posts and your guides that I can refer to you, if you'd like.

### Do you also do any data analysis, or data infrastructure work?

My focus is on qualitative research -- digging through messy anecdotes for clues, finding the trail of motivations that led a person to your door. But [I know a guy](https://www.lantrns.co/) who does the _quantitative_ part: setting up a data collection system that's replicable, producing insights from data. We can actually team up if that's what you're after: we could offer a complete solution from support channel trends to unearthing new Jobs-to-be-done through purchase interviews.

### Do I have to understand the Jobs-To-Be-Done theory, which I see you talk about a lot in your articles?

The Jobs-To-Be-Done theory of buyer behaviour ([here's an intro with some examples][jtbd-intro]) is pretty central to the practice I propose you take up. It insists on concepts like the ["struggling moment" being the requirement][try-when] for any start of a purchase journey, the main trigger for of all jobs-to-be-done. It talks about the [Four Forces of Progress][four-forces], "non-consumption" being your [major competition][non-consumption], and how you compete with surprising other alternatives. It's a strong lens you can use, and I highly recommend it.
