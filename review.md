title: A Service to Review Your Landing Page or Draft

<div class="pitch-lead-up" markdown="1">

**<mark>Your landing page isn't <em>clear</em> enough</mark>.**

You've been doing a fair bit on your own...

* you've started a page, got somewhere good...
* **could be for a product, could be for a service offering...**
* you've followed some best practices...
* you've tested with some people maybe...
* you've made some more edits...

Maybe you even followed some of [my own advice on copywriting](/articles) or on [creating struggle-first pages](/struggle-first).

<div class="pitch-lead-up-block" markdown="1">

<aside markdown="1">

Maybe you've asked for feedback on online forums (IndieHackers, Reddit, Facebook), and **people give you some silly feedback**... "too much text", "here's some more clever text", "add some testimonials", "follow this template".

You're not interested in that kind of feedback.

**Instead**, you're looking for someone who understands your visitors and their mental back and forth.

**Instead**, you're looking for a run-through of your page, to see where there are some holes that will make the visitors leave.

**Instead**, you've looking for ways to change your page to make your visitor say, with _enthusiasm_, "I feel seen!", "Yes, this, now".

</aside>

</div>

<div class="pitch-lead-up-block" markdown="1">

You want your page to be more clear than clever, more helpful that pushy, more bold than generic, more sharp than safe.

**And you've gone far enough on your own for this round of edits.** You'd like to bring someone in.

## You'll Get a Video a Bit Like This...

Here are a couple public video reviews I did recently. Yours will be a little more in depth, and it'll be private.

[Video 1] [Video 2]

## Feedback that Goes Deeper

**You'll notice that my feedback is different** than what you'll get from other people. It goes deeper than the surface stuff:

* Other reviewers will give you their first impressions.  
**I'll simulate a likely visitor's mental back and forth, starting from understanding their struggle, what they want progress on, and what will _cause_ them to go forward.**

* Other reviewers will rely heavily on best practices like "remove friction", "less is more", "make it more visually appealing".  
**I'll encourage you to stay concentrated on the task of helping your visitor through a problem they're experiencing.**

* Other reviewers will "roast" your site.  
**I'm not sure what that means, but I won't do that. I'll be straight with you, but I won't play feedback theatre.**

## We Might Not Be a Good Fit

* If you're here because you want a page that converts more people by adding slimy tactics, we won't be a good fit.  
**My advice will be about making the wrong visitors leave early so the best visitors scroll down and feel like they're being understood.**

* If you're here because you want a page that convinces and sells above all else, we won't be a good match either. People smell that from a mile away.  
**I'll help you make pages that create a ton of trust, the hard to get, hard to lose type of trust.**

* If I can't detect that your product or service addresses a [hard struggle][struggle], I won't be able to help.  
**People hardly ever buy nifty products, mere time savers or enterprise products unless there's an ambition, a context for switching away from a situation and toward a new one, a hard struggle creating the momentum to switch to something new. We need to find something close to that before I can help.**

## If I Were You...

If you'd like to try improving your site or draft some more before our call, here are a few articles I recommend:


**But if that's not going to be quick enough**, I'd love to help you speed things up with these options:

## My Three Options
{: #options }

---

### Option #1 - A Private Video Review

**CDN $265** - A private video where I comment on your page or a draft of a page. Roughly 30-45 minutes, bit more detailed what my public ones as in the examples above, and private.

By the end you'll get:

* The recording of the video, shared only with you;
* My view of the most important struggling moments causing your visitor to pay your site a visit;
* My take of the dynamics of the Forces of Progress, the back and forth in their mind, as visitors wanting progress on those struggles will likely experience... Attraction, Anxieties, what they'll default back to;
* The holes I see in your page: the spots that will create unexpected anxieties that might throw people away.
* More confidence in the parts of your page that you don't need to touch just yet.

**To proceed:**

[Fill out the questionnaire below {% include svg/caret-bottom.svg.html %}](#questionnaire){: .cta-btn } and specify Option #1. I'll get back to you to confirm availability before we proceed.

Paid in advance. I'll be making your video on Tuesday mornings, given my availability and a minimum 12 hours of heads up from you. You'll get the video by mid-afternoon Eastern Time on Tuesday.

### Option #2 - A Public Review

**Free**, but a little less detailed, a little less in-depth. Might not be a video.

Here's how it works: 

1. **Create a post on [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/group/landing-page-feedback) or Reddit** ([r/design_critiques](https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/), [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) or [r/Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/)),
2. Mention me in the description to invite me to comment (I'm @pascallaliberte),
3. and I'll receive the notification.

Could be fun to exchange about your site with other people. Will depend on my availability.

---

### Option #3 - A Week of Edits

**CDN $1450** - Part-time hands-on availability over a week to **concretely evolve your page**:

* We'll start on Monday with **a video review to kick things off**, giving you an idea about what I'll change about your site;
* Througout the week, I'll **evolve to a new version of your landing page**, keeping you in the loop;
* By Friday, you'll have a **deploy-ready version of the new page in your CMS**, with instructions on making it live.

I'll need your availability throughout the week to go deep in understanding your visitor's struggle. **Paid the week before**, given my availability.

**To proceed:**

[Fill out the questionnaire below {% include svg/caret-bottom.svg.html %}](#questionnaire){: .cta-btn } and be sure to click Option #3. I'll get back to you to confirm availability before we proceed.

Alternatively, if you'd just like to have a consultation call, please check out the **[/visualize](/visualize#details)** package which goes **CDN $250**, which includes an email back and forth ahead of the call, and a recording of our call.

I also offer a more in-depth service to peer into the minds of your buyers through purchase interviews, useful when you've gotten enough sales to know that you can go sharper with your product/service offering. That's the **[/understand](/understand#details)** package.
