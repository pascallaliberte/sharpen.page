Thanks for dropping by. My live streams are currently off and I might resume them in the future. You can find me on [Twitter][twitter] to be notified if I start them again.

## Past seasons:

* In Season 3 (Mar 24 - Apr 28, 2022), I worked on the landing page for [readwith.club](https://readwith.club), a small app to help sell your reading notes from a book you're reading.
* In Season 2 (Jan 27 - Mar 3, 2022), I put together the langing page for [stimulus.pascal.works](https://stimulus.pascal.works), a consultancy for those building an app and struggling with a Stimulus JS problem.
* In Season 1 (Fall of 2021), I was reviewing langing pages of other apps, **something I'm thinking of restarting soon.**

Stay Sharp!
