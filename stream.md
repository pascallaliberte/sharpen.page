In Season 3 (Mar 24 - Aril 28), I'm **deliberating on whether I should finish and launch** a small book-reading (groups) app.

**Will the app work?** Will people buy? Is it the answer to a [hard struggle][struggle]? Does it clear the [Forces of Progress][four-forces]?

[struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}
[four-forces]: {% post_url 2018-12-06-forces-of-progress-in-purchase-decision %}

Thursdays at 11am Eastern, 30 minutes.  
It'll be good. Don't miss it.

**And I've got a second stream for Rails devs.** Tuesdays at 3:30pm, I'll be practicing getting better at Rails, Hotwire. [This other one will be on YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo2CttXwSgcaEmrTsALqS-A/live). In this one, I'm actually building the book-reading (groups) app.

Stay Sharp!
