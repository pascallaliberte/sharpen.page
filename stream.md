[Join me on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/pascallaliberte) for live streams on crafting some landing pages, every Thursday at 11am Eastern.
{: .intro }

Each week, I'm working on some landing pages for some new productized services and new product ideas.

In season 1, I was doing landing page reviews and I'm thinking of making those recordings available.

**For season 2, I'm switching to building.** Join in to see how I zoom out to the visitor's perspective, plan out a page's structure, and iterate on some finer details.

Thursdays at 11am Eastern, 30 minutes. Hope you can join.

**And I've got a second stream for Rails devs.** Tuesdays at 3:30pm, I'll be practicing getting better at Rails. [This other one will be on YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo2CttXwSgcaEmrTsALqS-A/live).

Stay Sharp!
