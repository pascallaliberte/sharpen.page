[Join me on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/pascallaliberte) for live streams on buyer behavior, landing pages, and software product strategy, every Tuesday at 11am Eastern.
{: .intro }

---

I review landing pages ([yours maybe, read below](#your-site-reviewed)), I comment on products I find interesting too, all that through the lens of buyer behavior.

You'll find these streams useful if:

* you're hesitating about a **specific aspect of your landing page**;
* you're debating how a new feature you plan to add **will be received by your users**;
* you're unsure if a change to your purchase flow will **hurt or will help sales**;
* you're wondering whether people will **understand** your product;
* you're not sure **how to write the words** to describe your product;
* you're thinking **there's a way to improve something** about your product, but you're just not sure;
* you've **heard of Jobs-to-be-done** and you'd like to use that lens to peer into the mind of an undecided buyer;
* you'd like **your page reviewed** by me.

## Get Your Page Reviewed Live
{: #your-site-reviewed }

Run a chance to get your software landing page reviewed, **for free**. It can be an early draft, a page you're working on at a secret URL or the page you have in production. If you're feeling your software sales page could use some tweaks, I'd love to help.

To be eligible:

1. **Tweet a link to this page** (see some example tweets below). Preferably close to the stream (Monday or early Tuesday);
2. DM me your **link to your tweet** of step 1 (I'm [@pascallaliberte](https://twitter.com/pascallaliberte)  on Twitter);
3. DM me a **link to your landing page** you'd like me to review.

## Questions and Answers

### Q: Am I too late to get my page reviewed?

Every week, I look at some new pages. It's not too late to get your page in, and in fact, you're probably going to be one of the first ones ([I'm just starting](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsharpen.page%2Fstream&src=typed_query&f=live)).

### Q: Are you going to be doing these for a long time?

For sure until mid-December, maybe have another one close to Christmas, maybe start again in January. Who knows.

### Q: Does my page have to be finished for you to review it?

If you'd like your page reviewed, it really doesn't have to be perfect. A skeleton of a page will do, some sample copy will do, an all-text version is fine too.

### Q: Are the streams recorded?

Twitch shows the last 2 or 3 streams after the fact, and I keep a copy for later, but right now, they're not published for the long-term (not yet anyway, maybe later).

Hope you can make the next one.
