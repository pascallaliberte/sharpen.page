Can I interview you on a recent purchase you made?

I help product owners to understand buyers and their thinking process, and I'm offering to interview you on your recent purchase story.

## Here's the Offer:

For one hour of your time, I'd like to call you to hear the story of a recent purchase you made.

1. It can't be a gift you made
2. It was purchased recently (in the last 3 months)
3. It has to be a sizeable amount you paid (dozens and dozens of dollars)
4. And most importantly, the decision created some **back-and-forth in your mind**, making you deliberate the purchase.

## The Fine Print:

For your help I'll offer a gift certificate from Amazon for USD $70. I'll be recording the interview for my own records (not for the public)and I may use your story as an example in an article (with your name and sensitive bits removed).

## Start here:

You can change it later if something comes up.
