Some pages with articles lined up, sometimes videos, on where to start to do these things yourself. **You can do this.**

## [/struggle-first](/struggle-first)

**Free**, a collection of videos and articles on creating a Struggle-First marketing/landing page for your product or service. The kind of page that your visitor responds to by saying "I feel understood!". Useful when your thing helps a real struggle, but your audience doesn't have an established mindset about the solution yet.

## [/value-ladders](/value-ladders)

**Free**, a guide on creating a value-ladder of offerings for your solo consulting business. Move away from "here are my skills", and toward "here are valuable things I offer", all serving an overall struggle, all helping your visitor make progress, and each option competing with the others.

## [/interviews](/interviews)

**Free**, a collection of articles on conducting Jobs-to-be-done purchase interviews. You've heard of the benefits, so here's a place to bookmark for when you set out to run those interviews.
