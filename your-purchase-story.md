## Here's the Offer:

**For one hour of your time (Amazon gift card if chosen)**, can I call you to hear the story of a recent purchase you made? It can't be a gift you made, it has to be a sizable amount you paid (dozens and dozens of dollars), and most importantly, you were doing a **back-and-forth in your mind** before you decided to make the purchase.

## The Fine Print:

For your help, and if I select your purchase story, I'll offer **a gift certificate for Amazon for USD $60**. I'll be recording the interview for my own records (not for the public), but I reverse the right to use your story as an example in an article (with your name and sensitive bits removed).

## Thanks for your interest. Can I ask for some details abour your purchase?
