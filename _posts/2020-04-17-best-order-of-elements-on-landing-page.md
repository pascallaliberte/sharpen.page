excerpt: 
  Is there a definitive order? Let's see a few example structures, and in particular, the importance of telling your visitor you understand them. Then, makes sure the page flows.

Xander was the one to [ask the question on IndieHackers][thread], and I think it's a good one: **What _is_ the definitive best order of elements for a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) landing page?**

[thread]: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/a-default-site-structure-definite-answer-b4ca8b562f

> Okay people, I'm frustrated.  
> I've spend plenty of time on optimizing the homepage for [ratemymeeting.co][ratemymeeting]. But there is too many opinions around me of non-techies that I'm looking here for what I hope is somewhat of a definite answer.

Is there even such a thing as a _definitive_ answer?

**Let's try to avoid "it depends" tropes** and let's expose a few conventional structures, and some unconventional ones for fun. And at the end of the article, we'll talk about the importance of _flow_.

## Let's Run Through a Few Structures

Xander's proposed structure (A, D, E, F, C, B):

1. Hero
1. Problems
1. Essential Features
1. Benefits
1. Testimonial(s)
1. Company Logos
{: .page-structure }

{% include components/aside-note.html text="What's a Hero? It's that full-height introduction of the product you often see on pages. As we'll see below, there's something else you can start your page with." %}

Xander here didn't list "Calls to action" (CTA), those parts of a page that provide a button for the next step (signing up, trying the software, seeing a demo). Usually, that's in the Hero section (implied by Xander's order), but [Julian Shapiro's starter template][julians-guide] makes those explicit, and adds them more than once on the page:

[julians-guide]: https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/landing-pages

1. Hero
1. Social Proof
1. **CTA**
1. Features
1. **CTA**
1. Footer
{: .page-structure }

Julian also says this in his guide, which is smart:

> Counterintuitively, concise doesn't mean short

It's true. [Long landing pages make calls-to-action work better][long-pages], because:

* people naturally scroll anyway;
* you get multiple chances at making your point _with a variety of words_ (one of the words will eventually _connect_), and;
* you help your visitor make progress **by offering them the next step (the CTA) right where it makes sense**.

[long-pages]: {% post_url 2019-05-17-how-long-landing-pages-make-calls-to-action-work %}

But then there's [this unconventional page structure][ebook-landing-page]:

[ebook-landing-page]: {% post_url 2019-06-28-an-example-unconventional-landing-page %}

1. Pain
1. Pain
1. Pain
1. Product Peak, CTA
1. Pain
1. Pain
1. Dream
1. Social Proof
1. Dream
1. Social Proof
1. Fix: Product Intro
1. Social Proof
1. Product Options, CTA
1. Alternative: Newsletter signup
1. About the author
1. Social Proof
1. CTA
{: .page-structure }

That, my friends, is called the [Pain-Dream-Fix page structure][pain-dream-fix], and it is _glorious_.

[pain-dream-fix]: {% post_url 2019-11-08-pain-dream-fix-and-jtbd %}

1. Pain
1. Pain
1. Pain
1. Pain!
1. Dream!
1. Fix!
{: .page-structure }

You start with **Pain**: relating to the user [how much you understand their struggle][struggle]. No struggle, no need for a solution.

{% include components/aside-note.html text="Do you need to start the page with a struggle? Can I keep a brief product intro in a Hero section? Look below for a heuristic to help you decide." %}

You then describe the **Dream**, a way to [tell your visitor there's a better way][better-way].

Only then do you describe the **Fix**, your product or service. The visitor is completely on board at this point. You've tended to each of their hesitations. "I feel understood and I want that better future" is what they'll be thinking by the time you present them with the fix.

[struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}
[better-way]: {% post_url 2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way %}

But do you _need_ to start your page by describing the struggle. Can't you just describe the product briefly first?

## Can I Still Keep the Hero First?

Here's a simple heuristic:

1. **If your audience has an established mindset** for the product and its need, starting with a Hero describing the product is not a bad idea. Less is more, to the point, nothing wrong here.
2. **But if your audience does not have an established mindset** for the product and its need, a simpler headline and short text isn't too helpful. Instead, **start the page with "struggle-first" copy**, copy that relates the visitor's struggling [situation][level-3-sharpening] to them so they can say "I feel seen" and then proceed to scroll.

[level-3-sharpening]: {% post_url 2020-01-17-level-3-sharpening-so-you-can-rely-less-on-sales %}

Example: when Intercom started, it didn't have a hero with a "what you get" headline. [Intercom had a Before and After illustration contrasting the struggle and the solution][apple-intercom] **because their solution wasn't mainstream**. They used a struggle-first approach for their home page until the point where Intercom became synonymous with user communication in the SaaS market, until the struggle and the solution were a de-facto standard.

[apple-intercom]: {% post_url 2019-12-06-yeah-but-apple-intercom-have-features-benefits-pages %}

A Struggle-first or Pain-Dream-Fix page structure is generally your best bet unless your product is something popular and super obvious.

## Final Note About the Best _Order_

So what's the best order for your page?

Again here's a simple heuristic. Whether you do a Pain-Dream-Fix layout, or a Hero-Features-CTA page layout, you want to do this:

**Have each section answer the question the previous section creates.**

This will create _flow_.

The Pain-Dream-Fix layout does that by default. It builds up a big honking question, and then delivers it by unveiling the fix.

But in the case of a more typical landing page that Xander proposed originally...

1. Hero _Do you fix my situation?_
1. Problems _But how do you pull this off? **(So far, so good)**_
1. Essential Features _Will I have to change the way I do things? **(Starts to fall apart right about here)**_
1. Benefits _What other costs are there for me?_
1. Testimonial(s)
1. Company Logos
{: .page-structure }

In this case, right after exposing some of the essential features, it might be a good bet to re-assure the visitor about that big anxiety: [Will I have to change my own process to adopt this new software?][different-process]

And maybe there are other anxieties you can address throughout your page:

* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} "That [low price seems suspect][feedback-purplesoundstudios]"
  * in which case you'd explain how you get the job done, how you're planning to stick around for the long term.
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} "[those are too many features][feature-anxiety] for me to have to learn"
  * in which case it might be a good idea to pare down the features you show on the home page, and only show the ones that support the main [job-to-be-done][jtbd-intro], the [main struggle][just-one-struggle], and leave the rest of the features for power users (or cut them from your product completely.)
{: .forces }

[different-process]: {% post_url 2020-03-13-when-your-software-proposes-different-process %}
[feedback-purplesoundstudios]: {% post_url 2020-04-10-productized-services-feedback-for-purplesoundstudios %}
[feature-anxiety]: {% post_url 2019-02-15-when-a-feature-is-not-a-feature %}
[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}
[just-one-struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-20-focus-on-just-one-struggle %}

So it pays to map out [the forces that push and pull in the mind of the buyer as they scroll][pain-dream-fix] through your home page.

So whatever your page structure, **make sure it flows**: it catches the struggle the visitor came to your site to solve, and it catches all the mini-struggles your page creates as the visitor scrolls.

Stay Sharp!
