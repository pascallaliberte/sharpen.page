In the last article, we saw [how to pick the right call-to-action for contacting you][pick-cta]. What will make the user make the jump to schedule a call with you? Is that too much to ask, and should you be using an email link instead, a form, or maybe a questionnaire?

The central take-away: to make sure your call-to-action is the right one, make sure to make **whatever is in the _periphery_ of your call-to-action help with the internal back-and-forth of the user**, deliberating whether to contact you.

Add proof, catch anxieties and objections and address them, show you understand their pain, serve them in their [specific situation][try-when].

## Just One Call-to-Action: A Lot to Ask

To position yourself as the person to contact, to really show you're the person for the job, there might be a lot that needs to be communicated around your call-to-action.

For that reason, having a single call-to-action on your page is a lot to ask. It asks that link or button or form to work way too hard for you.

Also, it's expecting a lot from your visitor. A single call-to-action implies that the visitor will read every word, weigh every argument, follow every proof. They won't. It's asking too much from _them_ too.

## Multiple Calls-to-Action: The Long Landing Page

Take the edge off and take advantage of this approach: **make a very long landing page.**

By making a long landing page, you'll have **multiple chances to make your point as the reader scrolls**.

## Play by Play of a Long Landing Page

The landing page starts off by **showing how you understand their struggle** in vivid description. Maybe add a way for people to contact you there. The first call-to-action near the top will be for the return visitor, the one that's sure she wants to get in touch.

Further down, you **show proof** that you can address the problem.

At another point, you **address a few anxieties**: your availability, the next steps, your typical process, how you'll approach pricing.

Another invitation to get in touch maybe?

By this time, they've scrolled way down. **They're obviously interested to learn more**. So maybe offer them a way to fix their problem themselves, DYI-style. Because, as we've covered before, [your biggest competitor is their option to do it themselves][non-consumption], especially if they read so far down your page.

**This might be a good place to invite them to sign up** to your email notification list or to a short email-based course.

And once you've showed your visitors how to do it themselves, this is a good time to show how working with you will get them the outcome they want, but _faster_, or by **requiring less of their time**, or showing them how working with you will make them learn something new. The fact that they'll learn something new from you might be the _actual_ deciding factor that makes them hire you.

At some point, work in some testimonials if you've got some. Portfolio examples or case study excerpts linking to a longer page, those would be nice too. But showing them you understand their pain and can address it on a long landing page, **that will give you an edge compared to other consultants who rely on just their portfolio or case studies** on shorter landing pages.

Long landing pages give you plenty of opportunities to show you understand your visitor's struggle, that you're the expert to stay in touch with, and the person to contact. Each call-to-action will be well-supported by its surrounding content, and will come at just the right time to help their internal back-and-forth on how to get progress on their problem.

Stay Sharp!

_P.S. While reading this article, are you by chance picturing how your own landing page could be rejigged into a long landing page?
