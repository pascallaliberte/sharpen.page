**How do you come up with a good headline** for your product idea? Something catchy, memorable, distinctive. Something different than the competition.

[Alex posted on IndieHackers][thread] to get feedback on his product's landing page. His product is called [minutes ai][minutesai], and here's the top of the landing page. We'll work on that headline:

[thread]: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/new-landing-page-need-feedback-491ee810be
[minutesai]: https://www.minutesai.com

The product's cleverness is that it not only transcribes audio using "state-of-the-art" Artificial Intelligence, **it also picks up and annotates the important components of a meeting**: action items, company names mentioned, people's names mentioned, who spoke, etc. Pretty neat stuff.

Those are some technical feats worth mentioning on the page. **Those features definitely make this product stand out from the competition.**

But maybe it's not so useful to _lead_ pitching the product with those characteristics. Not if you want to **connect with the mindset of the buyer**.

## Getting Into the Mind of the Buyer

Over here, we're big fans of [getting into the mind of the buyer][page-any-good] and making the words on the page connect with the [situation bringing the buyer to the page][level-3-sharpening].

[page-any-good]: {% post_url 2019-06-20-i-dont-know-if-my-page-is-good %}
[level-3-sharpening]: {% post_url 2020-01-17-level-3-sharpening-so-you-can-rely-less-on-sales %}

Most of my advice rests on the [theory of buyer motivation called Jobs-To-Be-Done][jtbd-intro]. In short: people don't just purchase a product, they [_hire_ a product for a _job_][jtbd-intro]. They've got a job to get done, and they hire the product that will fulfill that job.

[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

**One of the instincts when learning about Jobs-to-be-done** is to put a headline on a product page that describes an outcome. "Get X". "Increase Y".

In the case of _minutes ai_, "Convert your meetings into data" sounds like a headline about a product's Job-to-be-done.

But I don't know that that's a Job-to-be-done **that describes reality**. It might not describe the struggle that made them come to your product's page in the first place. ([There's always a struggle.][struggle])

[struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}

## Describing Reality in Your Main Headline

It may be the case that **people coming out of a meeting want to turn the meeting's minutes into something more searchable**. In this case, we could write a headline like this: 

> Make that meeting recording searchable. We're like nothing else on the market for audio transcription: we pick out the "what" and the "who" of the meeting. See for yourself.

It may be the case that **a manager wants more transparency** and make every meeting available for the whole company. [On this podcast from Brian Rhea, Buffer CEO Joel Gascoigne shared][buffer-podcast] that they go for this type of extreme transparency. For that, maybe something like.

[buffer-podcast]: https://www.brightandearlypodcast.com/31

> Make meeting recordings searchable across your company. Action items? Companies mentioned? We pick those details out from our unique audio transcription tech.

With these headings, we're getting closer to the reality of they buyers coming to the site (and what they'd be typing into DuckDuckGo to find the product).

But you might say: "yeah but my product can do different jobs for different people". The tempation here will be to keep to generics. Add features to the product to appeal to more people, keep the main headline generic. The cure for this is to **dig for even more reality**.

## Going Deeper: the Real Switching Moments

[In this article, I make the case for three levels of sharpening][level-3-sharpening] our understanding of the buyer:

1. **Not Sharp Enough:** Understanding the Role, the Market and The Benefits
2. **Sharp:** Understanding the Problem and the Aspiration
3. **Sharpest:** Understanding the _Situations_ That Are Ripe for the "Switch"

At the sharpest, our understanding of buyers of _minutes ai_ might help us find out situations that had so much momentum, so much urgency, that buyers gladly bit the bullet. **Those situations might very well be surprising**:

* Buyers _hired_ the product to **meet a deadline and find an important fact**. "Something was said in one of these recordings and I just need to find out the actual context of what was said".
* Buyers _hired_ the product to protect against future finger-pointing. The culture has been steadily going toward less accountability for a while, and **all of a sudden one person of importance promised something in a meeting** and didn't keep his word, and that made the culture worse. Enough is enough.

This level of knowledge might not change what the product page's main headline will say, but it will **help you focus your attention on improving the actual features** that supported the real job-to-be-done of the product. It might help you in your sales calls, knowing with confidence [when a potential buyer just isn't yet ready to change orbit][changing-orbit], or spotting those folks for whom your product really could be coming at good time.

[changing-orbit]: {% post_url 2019-01-10-changing-orbit-selling-your-idea %}

So that's what I'd concentrate on to improve the main headline for [minutes ai][minutesai].

Stay Sharp!
