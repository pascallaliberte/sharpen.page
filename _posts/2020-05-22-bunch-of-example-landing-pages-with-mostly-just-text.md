excerpt:
  No need for those unecessary photos or illustrations. See these examples pages I'm listing, they're mostly just text, and they work just fine. Make that wordy, Struggle-First page!

In this [thread][thread], the following question pops-up (emphasis mine):

> I have been trying to build a landing page for a while. **I don’t want to use stock photos or those overused illustrations** that don’t really convey anything. However, **eliminating these two choices leaves me with an all-text page**. How should I approach this? Should I draw some basic images myself? Should I give up and go the generic route?

## Wordy, Mostly-Text Pages are Fine

A couple articles ago, I wrote about [why it's okay to have a page with mostly just text][mostly-text].

[mostly-text]: {% post_url 2020-05-08-too-much-text-what-to-do-about-that-feedback %}

And so, to show what I mean, here are more examples of wordy pages.

These are also great examples of [Struggle-First pages](/struggle-first). See how the pages **start by telling the visitor how much they understand what they're going through?** If the thing your building respond to a real struggle, be confident about ditching those unecessary pictures, and go with a wordy page.

People come to your page to [make progress][slimy-jerk], so help them do that.
