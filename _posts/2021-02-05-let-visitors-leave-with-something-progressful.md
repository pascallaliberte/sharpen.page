excerpt:
  The bottom of a product's landing page is prime real estate. People scrolled all the way down, and yet they're not going to buy. They're about to leave, so might as well help them make progress. Let's look at Payzip's site, which is a good example of that.
---

Here's a page that has a **useful ending**. [Payzip][payzip] is software that helps people who manage clubs. 

[![The top of Payzip's home page describes how it helps club treasurers take control of membership payments](/assets/images/posts/2021-02-05-let-visitors-leave-with-something-progressful-01.jpg)][payzip]

Running a social club produces struggles around managing _memberships_: sending invoices for renewals, making payments easy, making that whole process smooth. From head-aches to no-brainer. That's the progress treasurers and membership secretaries are sometimes looking to make, and Payzip helps with that.

You'd think that their home page would end with one more invitation to sign up. No.

It ends like this:

[![The bottom of Payzip's home page doesn't end with another plea to try. It helps visitors make progress with something smaller: tips on managing club payments](/assets/images/posts/2021-02-05-let-visitors-leave-with-something-progressful-02.jpg)][payzip]
{: .img-zoom }

They're helping people who scrolled down, but probably won't buy it. Helping how? Helping them make progress anyway.

## Scrolled All the Way Down, About to Leave Anyway

1. They feel the struggle. Membership renewals getting too much to handle.
1. They considered Payzip and its features, that added a bit of attraction.
1. They had some hesitations, some anxieties, and the page helped them [reduce those anxieties, building more attraction][reduce-anxieties].
1. They scrolled some more, imagined using the product.
1. They're thinking they could figure something out _for now_.
1. They saw all those invitations to sign-up. They ignored those.
1. They get to the bottom of the page, thinking:

[reduce-anxieties]: {% post_url 2020-10-30-to-add-appeal-first-reduce-anxieties %}

> This thing is neat. I want to get moving, but this is too much for now.

## They're Ready for Progress, but Not This, Not Now

They're ready to get moving on solving their problem, they're just not ready to make the _big leap_ to Payzip.

* The big leap in **moving all their stuff** to a new system.
* The big leap of **convincing the board** to have visitors go through this new system.
* The big leap of weighing the pros and cons of the move, **making it a _project_**.

**They're sold on doing _something_.** They're not yet sold on buying this. Not this, not now.

But they're at the bottom of the page, and they're ready to make one small tweak. The Payzip landing page helps them with _that_. Make progress on this small bit. Brilliant use of the bottom of the page.

[![You can see there's a call to action just above that final section. But this ending is for people who we're going to buy anyway, and were on their way out.](/assets/images/posts/2021-02-05-let-visitors-leave-with-something-progressful-02.jpg)][payzip]

If people visiting your site are tempted to figure out something on their own before buying, it's in your interest to help them do _that_. It's the progress they want to make. Most products are in that boat anyway: [we're all in competition with non-consumption][non-consumption] more than we are with competing products. So they'll figure something out themselves (with your help), and then they might hit a wall. Then they'll be back. Because you'll have helped them along the way.

Stay Sharp!

_P.S. I've been running a landing page review meetup. In fact, I found out about Payzip when Jaymie joined the first one. I hope you can [join one of the next meetups too][review-meetup-signup]._
