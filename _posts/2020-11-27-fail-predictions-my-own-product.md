excerpt:
  I was building a product (a paid video of sorts). I spotted a few problems with it. I'm killing it.

This wasn't planned.

These past few articles were about product failure. The previous article was about a [fail prediction of a startup-y product][sunshine-contacts].

All the while I've been working on a product on the side, and this article will be about why I predict it'll fail and how I decided I should pull the plug.

## A "video" "product"

I called it "A Standard Review for Standard Layouts". I was planning to pre-sell a pre-recorded interactive "video". You include your landing page on the left, me and my face and my "tool" on the right, and I run through your landing page to review it.

![Snapshot of the product's pre-order page with a sample video where you could put in your page's URL and where I explained the product](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-27-fail-predictions-my-own-product-01.jpg)

> But it's pre-recorded! How can you review my site if you haven't seen it?

If your page had what I called a "standard layout" (Hero at the top, then a Features section, then either How it works/Testimonials/Benefits, then Signup/Pricing), the "review" "video" would point out the things your page was most likely missing. 

You could upload a mockup or enter a URL, you could adjust the video to scroll to the exact point in the page where you had each section. (The video itself was just my face, everything else was animated via JavaScript.)

I was going to show you how to see the page through the eyes of a visitor. I was going to use the [Forces of Progress][four-forces] to show you how a good landing page flows well by working with the mental back-and-forth of the visitor, to help them make progress.

I was spending half a day a week on this for several weeks. I showed it to a friend who found it hard to understand. I decided to kill it.

## The Problem: A Stunt Is Not Always a Good Product

**A stunt** attracts attention, makes a statement, pushes on people's mental models.

**A product** helps a person with a struggle make progress away from "this isn't working" and toward an aspiration.

It was more of a stunt than a product. And it wasn't a good product.

Lost in the idea of the stunt was a lack of clarity on what you got when you bought the product.

That lack of clarity, the need to explain, it [added too much anxiety][reduce-anxieties] to the visitor. "What the hell is this anyway?"

And so I set out to see if it could be [salvaged][your-product-will-fail]. See if I could pivot, re-arrange the landing page. Maybe use a [struggle-first](/struggle-first) layout instead.

## Trying Out a Struggle-First Layout

Since [nobody had an established mindset](/struggle-first/vs-features-benefits/) for a "standard review", the landing page layout of choice is a struggle-first layout. You start by mirroring back to the visitor the struggle they're going through. They respond by feeling "this person understands me", and they scroll. And then you intro the product.
