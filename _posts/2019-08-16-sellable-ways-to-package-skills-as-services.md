You're pretty good at what you do, you've been taking freelance or consulting contracts (or you're starting that up), and the word-of-mouth keeps getting you the same kind of clients. But you want _better_ clients, and you want referrals that highlight **something new you're specializing in**.

**Or maybe you head up an agency**. You find you rely too much on work coming through a partnership, or your clients have followed a trend you'd like to break. **Same-old got old**. You'd like to pierce through that invisible ceiling and attract the kind of new client your team is primed to delight.

## Anxieties About Your Services

In the previous article, we've seen how, despite your best efforts at presenting yourself on your web presence, [there are a lot of anxieties in hiring your service business][previous] (list copied from the other article):

* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I'm not sure if I'll be able to translate what I'm going through in terms they'll really understand;
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I'm hesitating about the fact that I might not understand the technical bits they'll be talking about when describing their solution;
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I'm not prepared for them to upsell me with things I don't need;
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I'm not sure we'll be able to communicate effectively, when working together;
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I don't know if it'll take a lot of time, what I'm asking for;
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I don't know if it'll cost a lot of money, what I'm asking for;
* {% include components/icon-anxieties.html %} I'm not sure they can do exactly what I need to get done.

But as we've seen in that article, **packaging up a service to address a specific struggle** gives you more chances to reduce anxieties, have your clients confidently know what makes your service attractive, and **help the client make some progress**.

Do that, and you'll get some _go-hood_ word-of-mouth. So let's make a list of packaged service ideas.

## A Bunch of Example Ways to Package up Services

For each of these, you could make a full page describing what the client gets by purchasing that package. You can show your availability, some pricing guidance, what the process of working with you will be like, how long it will take. See if there's a way to address all the anxieties listed above through that page.

For some of these, you could even offer three different options, helping them through their choice to work with you.

And of course, some of these are products themselves.

**All of them are a great way to try you on for size.** Remember, your main competitor is [your clients considering doing it themselves first][non-consumption].

## "I See Selling Multiple Services Like These"

As we've seen in the [previous article][previous], having multiple services packaged up like these allows each service to compete against each other, rather than competing against other competitors. The point is to make your service offerings _sharp_, not generic, and the same should be said about your _group_ of service offerings. Each one points to the other as an alternative, or as a complement.

Also make sure that, as a whole, you communicate that you're there to help your clients **make progress**, and that you're the person or agency to "bookmark" for future needs. [Your newsletter will be a great way][newsletter] for those clients to "hire" your influence, to "bookmark" you for later, without much cost to them.
