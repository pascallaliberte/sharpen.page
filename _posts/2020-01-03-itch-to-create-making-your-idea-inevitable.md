You've decided that your new idea is worth a shot. You will be doing something about that itch to create.

By putting in the effort to [identify your 'why' (in Part 1)][part-1], you were able to dissassociate yourself from your feeling of excitement, and you saw more clearly why you'd even consider going for your idea.

In short: you've realized that you're **not in it to put a product on the market** just yet. You've also realized that **there might be a way to not make it compete against your day-to-day** too much, and the key is to think that developing this idea will be a **good context for sharpening a skill**.

[part-1]: {% post_url 2019-12-27-itch-to-create-getting-clarity-on-why %}

But you're still left with a history of rarely finishing what you started. Maybe it was about procrastination, maybe it was about lack of clarity, maybe it was about miscalculating the amount of effort required to finish it.

Still, you're weary. Will you finish your idea, this time around?

To make sure you finish it, to **make your project _inevitable_**, we'll **start by picturing what "finishing it" looks like.**

## Visualizing the End - An Intro to _Have-Done Lists_

There is a technique I use that I call _Have-Done Lists_. It replaces to-do lists and it removes the need for estimates or priority levels (low-med-high). It even removes the need for a _to-do system_ (like Getting Things Done, which I ditched in favour of this method), because this technique doesn't hold onto old lists. **_Have-Done Lists_ favour starting with now, and to look to the future**. It assumes we're throwing away the past, and sets the focus on a point somewhere in the future, a point describing the _end_.

The end of the day...

<pre class="have-done pre-wrap" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the <mark>day</mark>, I'll have:**
  ...
</pre>

The end of the month...

<pre class="have-done pre-wrap" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the <mark>month</mark>, I'll have:**
  ...
</pre>

And, of course, the end of your _project_...

<pre class="have-done pre-wrap" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the <mark>project</mark>, I'll have:**
  ...
</pre>

## Re-writing Statements _Until They Will Be True_

Beneath that heading describing the _end_, let's write statements, and let's re-write them until they ring _true_.

Each statement starts with a past participle (_Obtained, Finished, Started, Advanced on..._).

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the project, I'll have:**
  <mark>Published</mark> it in the wild
  <mark>Made</mark> it work with all the edge cases
  <mark>Made</mark> the implementation high quality
  <mark>Obtained</mark> some attention
  <mark>Obtained</mark> some sign-ups
</pre>

Last time, we identified that the key to this project's success was that it'll **allow you to sharpen a skill**. That's missing from that list...

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the project, I'll have:**
  Published it in the wild
  Made it work with all the edge cases
  Made the implementation high quality
  Obtained some attention
  Obtained some sign-ups
  <mark>Sharpened a skill</mark>
</pre>

## Re-ordering Statements until the First Statement Will Be the Most True

An important part of re-writing these statements is to change their order, until the top statement will be the most true by the end of the project, and all other statements will be ordered by descending true-ness (by the end of the project).

You can even indent them, which states that one thing will help making the other thing become true.

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the project, I'll have:**
  Sharpened a skill
  Obtained some attention
    Published it in the wild
  Made the implementation high quality
    Made it work with all the edge cases
  Obtained some sign-ups
</pre>

At the top of the list, we have the statement that will be the most true by the end of the project. And the ones below that, well they're wishful thinking (the point is that you can be honest about it).

This allows us to be really clear about our intentions. And it allows us to ask some deeper questions...

> How sharp does our skill need to be anyway? Can I be specific somehow?

> By the time we'll be able to say we'll have sharpened that skill, **what will we be able to say we'll have done**?

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**<mark>Before I can say I'll have sharpened my skill</mark>, I'll have:**
  Understood the subtleties
    Understood the different angles
      Tried recreating this idea <mark>three different ways</mark>
  Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
</pre>

"Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill": this is _really_ interesting. Who is this person? Someone who might help you get some work in the future? A way to have **"Obtained some attention"** maybe?

And why do you want to sharpen that skill exactly? **So you can say you'll have "Advanced on ensuring more prosperity"**.

Let's tie that all back to the larger context: the end of the project.

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the project, I'll have:**
  <mark>Advanced on ensuring more prosperity</mark>
    Sharpened a skill
      Understood the subtleties
        Understood the different angles
          Tried recreating this idea three different ways
      <mark>Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill</mark>
    Obtained some attention
      <mark>Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill</mark>
        Shared my progress with this person
      Obtained some attention from people outside my circles
        Published updates about it in the wild
    Made the implementation high quality
      Made it work with all the edge cases
    Obtained some sign-ups
</pre>

So now you're clear that you're doing this to get more prosperity, and you'll do it two ways. By sharpening that skill, and as a way to get attention for that skill. So long as those two are in order, you'll be honest with yourself.

To be even _more_ honest with yourself, let's bring it back in a real context, within a real time-box.

## Installing Those Statements Within a Real Time-box

A real time-box might be the end of the month...

<pre class="have-done pre-wrap" markdown="block">
**Before the end of the month, I'll have:**
  ...
</pre>

Or it might be something even more real, that's occupying your thoughts, and that gives a hard deadline, like a conference you plan to go to:

<pre class="have-done pre-wrap" markdown="block">
**<mark>Before that conference</mark> that's coming up in a few months, I'll have:**
  ...
</pre>

This, right here, is the last part to make your project **inevitable**. It has to be **installed amongst everything else** you got going. First, you'll have to make sure you'll have **taken care of your family**.

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before that conference that's coming up in a few months, I'll have:**
  <mark>Taken care of my family
    Ensured some revenue
    Taken care of my health and well-being</mark>
  Advanced on ensuring more prosperity
    Sharpened a skill
      Understood the subtleties
        Understood the different angles
          Tried recreating this idea three different ways
      Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
    Obtained some attention
      Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
        Shared my progress with this person
      Obtained some attention from people outside my circles
        Published updates about it in the wild
</pre>

And you might have made other commitments, which _includes_ taking care of your family:

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before that conference that's coming up in a few months, I'll have:**
  <mark>Met my commitments</mark>
    Taken care of my family
      Ensured some revenue
      Taken care of my health and well-being
    <mark>Met my other commitments</mark>
      ...
  Advanced on ensuring more prosperity
    Sharpened a skill
      Understood the subtleties
        Understood the different angles
          Tried recreating this idea three different ways
      Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
    Obtained some attention
      Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
        Shared my progress with this person
      Obtained some attention from people outside my circles
        Published updates about it in the wild
</pre>

But! This skill you plan to sharpen, you might even make it a public commitment, either to that person you know, or publicly on social media. To make sure you can keep it, you can write a statement **which will be true.**

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before that conference that's coming up in a few months, I'll have:**
  Met my commitments
    Taken care of my family
      Ensured some revenue
      Taken care of my health and well-being
    Met my other commitments
      ...
      <mark>Posted, at least every two weeks, about my progress learning this skill</mark>
  Advanced on ensuring more prosperity
    Sharpened a skill
      Understood the subtleties
        Understood the different angles
          Tried recreating this idea three different ways
      Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
    Obtained some attention
      Obtained feedback from someone I know that has the skill
        Shared my progress with this person
      Obtained some attention from people outside my circles
        Published updates about it in the wild
</pre>

At this point, you've obtained something that became:

* **Central, rather than a distraction**, because you know its utility compared to everything else, and sits close to the top of your list.
* **Installed, rather than being a wish**, because you've found the **smallest viable thing to do to satisfy what a success at the end will look like** and a real physical deadline that forces you to make choices and trade-offs.

Those two traits, "central" and "installed" are what makes a project **inevitable**. And you get that by picturing the end, and **re-writing statements until they sound true**.

Things will come up between now and then, and at each point, you'll be able to re-write those statements, or use them to manage those commitments you make to other people.

Which, really, should now become your first statement on the list:

<pre class="have-done" markdown="block">
**Before that conference that's coming up in a few months, I'll have:**
  <mark>Ensured I only take commitments I can keep</mark>
  Met my commitments
  ...
</pre>

Stay sharp!

P.S. Now that we've introduced [_Mental Models_ (Part 1)][part-1] and _Have-Done Lists_ (Part 2, above), we're set for the act of _tweaking_ our thoughts **so we can calibrate them against outside advice**. In Part 3, that's what we'll do: we'll be incorporating other people's sharp advice.
