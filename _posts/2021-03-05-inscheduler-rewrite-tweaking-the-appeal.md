excerpt:
  Now that we know what goes on in the mind of InScheduler's best buyer, let's fill the holes in the site, starting with how the product is described to the visitor.
---

[Last time][inscheduler-rewrite-part-3], we saw how [InScheduler.com][inscheduler] created questions it didn't answer, even for its best buyers.

[inscheduler]: https://inscheduler.com/
[inscheduler-rewrite-part-1]: {% post_url 2021-02-12-inscheduler-rewrite-initial-run-through %}
[inscheduler-rewrite-part-2]: {% post_url 2021-02-19-inscheduler-rewrite-situations-ripe-for-a-switch %}
[inscheduler-rewrite-part-3]: {% post_url 2021-02-26-inscheduler-rewrite-testing-against-best-buyer-situation %}

In this article, we'll propose a first set of changes to the page, concentrating on fixing the description of the product for its best buyers. Next article, we'll go further into pricing and the buyer's next steps.

## The Best Buyers Are In This Situation

Recap from [Part 2][inscheduler-rewrite-part-2]: the best buyers are those who are experiencing a hard struggle, and where their "I'll just" alternatives just won't do. This is the struggling situation that we identified:

**When** we're getting a lot of new clients from the website, but a lot of no-shows too  
**I want to** find a way to get these strangers to commit  
**So I can** focus on the clients present in the shop, and not be worrying about no-shows.

It's a dual situation: these hair salon/barbershop/spa owners are getting steady business from their websites, but they're getting no-shows too. In this context, InScheduler is interesting. "Give me a way to book people, I'll get my no-shows taken care of."

That situation will bring them to the page with eagerness. But as we've seen in [Part 3][inscheduler-rewrite-part-3], when experiencing the page, they'll have questions.

## The Buyer Will Have Questions

In this spot, they'll know that InScheduler adds a widget to the page. But they'll have these questions pop up:

> Will this work on my site?

> Do I have to be the one to install this thing on my site? I don't know how.

So it would be a real service to our visitors to answer those questions right there:

![This spot right next to the demo widget would be just the spot to answer questions about installing the widget on any site](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-01.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

Right below the paragraph for "Our Widget, Your Site", let's add another paragraph to re-assure.

![Maybe add a paragraph like this: To install this on your own site, it's just an extra line of code. We'll show you how to do that, and we can even install it for you.](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-02.jpg)

And then just above the example site, a heading to help the visitor understand how the widget fits in.

![And above the demo video, let's add the heading: Here's how it looks on an example site.](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-03.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

## The Missing Product Screenshots

Just below the example website, we enter the part of the page that shows the product with screenshots.

There's a couple screenshots missing.

At this point in the page, when the visitor will see the back-end, the calendar that they will see, they'll be worried about a couple things.

![After seeing a video of the widget demonstrated on a site, they're shown the back-end calendar view. Is it easy to pencil someone in? That's the question they'll have in mind.](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-04.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

> What about the people who usually call in? Can I pencil them in quickly?

So that's one screenshot that's missing.

![Before we look at the calendar view, I'd instead add a section showing how easy it is to pencil someone in when they call for an appointment.](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-05.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

And then further below, we see the image of the email the client will be getting. But then the question comes up:

> But is that going to be enough to reduce no-shows?

So let's add a screenshot of the reminder email (assuming there is one).

![In addition to showing me a screenshot of the email the clients will be getting, show me the reminder email too.](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-06.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

## These Changes Will Reduce Anxieties, Adding Appeal

[To add appeal, you're usually better off reducing anxieties][reduce-anxieties]. For the buyers of InScheduler, the anxieties revolve around pulling this tool into their existing business. Sure, a salon that's opening up might consider installing InScheduler, ["hire" the tool][jtbd-intro] as the official scheduling assistant of sorts. But even for owners opening up a new salon, having a site that is clearer about those extra details will reduce anxieties.

[reduce-anxieties]: {% post_url 2020-10-30-to-add-appeal-first-reduce-anxieties %}
[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

The big remaining anxiety to fix: pricing and the interested buyer's next steps.

[![Then the visitor scrolls down to the pricing. There's room for improvement here.](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-05-inscheduler-rewrite-tweaking-the-appeal-07.jpg)][inscheduler]

We can do something about that, and let's tackle that next time.

Stay Sharp!
