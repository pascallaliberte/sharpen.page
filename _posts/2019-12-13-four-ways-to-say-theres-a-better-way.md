You've found ways to communicate to your visitor that [you understand their hard struggle][struggle]. You start off your landing page with [a minimum of evidence to demonstrate that you do][minimum-struggle] so that your visitor can quickly say ["I feel seen!"][cferdinandi-tweet]

[struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}
[minimum-struggle]: {% post_url 2019-10-25-minimum-to-get-struggle-based-landing-page %}
[cferdinandi-tweet]: https://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi/status/1194996929027026944

So, now what? On your landing page, what should come right after the struggle? Jump straight to your solution? "I understand your problem, now here's my service, here's my product".

You _could_ jump straight from problem to solution. **But maybe you'd want to add a section in between those two.**

We recently saw [the Pain-Dream-Fix layout, and how it jives well with the theory of Jobs-To-Be-Done][pain-dream-fix]. It proposed three main sections: in between the Pain and the Fix, **there's an important section: the _Dream_**.

[pain-dream-fix]: {% post_url 2019-11-08-pain-dream-fix-and-jtbd %}

Imagine your visitor feeling understood, and right away being presented with a product, with a service.

**Instead, imagine your visitor being in that state of feeling understood, and you instead lay out a new hypothetical situation where the problem no longer exists.** The visitor now feels _even more understood_ and feels like her situation is **not a one-off**. "There's an official way out of this mess."

Here are four ways taken **from the wild** which show a way forward without talking about the solution _per se_.

## 1. The "Instead of/You'll have" and "Before and After" Patterns

This is a classic visual technique. It juxtaposes the struggling situation besides a future, better situation. **This creates contrast**, and is effective at making your point.

Here we see old versions of basecamp.com and intercom.io using the technique to great effect:

<div class="img-zoom two-up" markdown="1">

<div class="left" markdown="1">
![Older Basecamp home page, showing the Instead of...You'll have pattern](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way-01.jpg)
</div>

<div class="right" markdown="1">
![Intercom home page from 2015, showing the Before and After pattern](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-06-yeah-but-apple-intercom-have-features-benefits-pages-04.jpg)
</div>

</div>

And here's an example of "Before and After" using just text, from the current basecamp.com home page.

![Current Basecamp home page, using Before and After with just text](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way-02.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

## 2. "Deserve"

A few articles ago, we looked at the landing page of [applicationemail.com from Garrett Dimon][applicationemail].

[applicationemail]: {% post_url 2019-11-01-sharp-example-applicationemail %}

Here, Garrett uses the "Deserve" word to transport the visitor to a new possibility:

![Garrett Dimon's applicationemail.com uses You and your customers deserve…](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way-03.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

## 3. "Wouldn't It Be Much Better If..."

In the article [An Example Of An Unconventional Landing Page][ebook-landing-page], we saw how the Struggle-First page layout works well to sell an ebook.

[ebook-landing-page]: {% post_url 2019-06-28-an-example-unconventional-landing-page %}

Nestled into the copy, we see this dream pattern in the form of "Wouldn't it be much better if?"

![Jim Gay's clean-ruby.com uses Wouldn't it much better if?](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way-04.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

## 4. "What If?"

And lastly, here's an example from [Meg Cumby's service offering page][meg].

Meg offers the service of interviewing your past clients to write testimonials for your consulting business (pretty neat!)

After showing she understands the struggle of how awkward it is to ask past clients for testimonials, she shows a way forward by using "What if?".

The _Dream_ on her page fits succintly in a single headline:

[meg]: https://megcumby.com

![Meg Cumby succintly tackles the dream in a single heading: What if you could get effective testimonials & case studies without all the awkwardness & pain?](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way-05.jpg)
{: .img-zoom }

## A few more...

All of these are great ways to establish that your product, that your service, has the means to achieve the outcome your visitor's after. It says: "I can help you [make the progress you want to be making][slimy-jerk]".

[slimy-jerk]: {% post_url 2019-07-19-how-to-improve-conversion-rates-without-being-a-slimy-jerk %}

These approaches take the visitor out of their day-to-day, and transports them where it no longer hurts.

**When falling on these bits of text, they can connect the dots between "this, now" and "over there, _soon_".**

Want a few more ways to write the _Dream_?

{:start="5"}
5. "Imagine if"
6. "Let's Pretend We're in the Future"
7. "It Doesn't Have to Be This Way"
8. "Here's a Different Scenario"

Or, simply:

{:start="9"}
9. "There's a Better Way"

Stay Sharp!
