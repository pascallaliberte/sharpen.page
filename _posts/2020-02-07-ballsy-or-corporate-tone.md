On [this IndieHackers thread, Xander asks][thread]:

> A friend today advised me to be more ballsy on [ratemymeeting.co][ratemymeeting] copy. Not 'improve your meeting effectiveness', but 'make your meetings s*ck less'.  
> I'd be happy to hear any of your thoughts.

## My Answer...

**Ballsy is great!**

What could really make a difference are a few ["Maybe" statements][just-one-struggle].

[just-one-struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-20-focus-on-just-one-struggle %}

## "Maybe" Statements Right at the Top

Here's what I'd change:

1. I'd **push down the "How it works" section** right below the headline.
1. I'd replace that spot with a heading that says **"Are you going through something like this?"**
1. I'd follow with a list of some [situations that are ripe for a switch][level-3-sharpening], that the visitor, upon reading, will likely respond with **"you understand exactly what I'm going through"**

[level-3-sharpening]: {% post_url 2020-01-17-level-3-sharpening-so-you-can-rely-less-on-sales %}

For example: 

> ## Are you going through something like this?
>
> * Maybe you were just asked, for the first time, to **lead a meeting with a larger group than usual** and participants will come out of the meeting getting something useful. You'd like to collect feedback from participants.
> * Maybe you're in a new leadership position, and **you'll be leading with an inclusive style**. Getting the feedback from others is a way to fulfill that pledge. 
> * Maybe the team you inherited isn't opening up to you. Maybe they've been burnt by empty promises in the past, and **you know some people have something to say**.

Only after a section like this would I follow with a demonstration of how the product works.

Having a range of "maybes" allows for your product to attract a variety of customers, but they all fit with this [overall struggle][just-one-struggle]: 

**Our meetings can't suck anymore**. "Enough is Enough"

## "Enough is Enough": Situations that Are Ripe for a Switch

Finding these "switching moments" requires that we go beyond thinking about the generic problem we're solving, and instead turning our attention to the [situations that just precede them going for your product][level-3-sharpening].

What makes it suck so much about running meetings that they would [stop using their cobbled-together mix of solutions][non-consumption] (which is your product's real competition)?

What makes them say "yes, this, now" to your product, **and say "no" to**:

* Asking a trusted team member for feedback?
* Having a direct, one-on-one conversation with the silent person that seemed to be fuming?
* Asking their own boss or mentor for advice on how to deal with situations like these?
* Picking up an audiobook or searching youtube on running an effective meeting?

[non-consumption]: {% post_url 2018-12-17-universal-competitor %}

**That's some tough competition!**

A ballsy headline is catchy and all, but nothing will spread the word and make the visitors say ["I feel seen"][cferdinandi-tweet] like sharp, specific, vivid, cripsy descriptions of real situations that they're likely going through.

To find those, it pays to [interview your recent buyers][interview-questions] in order to uncover their [purchase story][purchase-story]. After a few interviews, you'll have some real situations to relate to directly on your home page.
