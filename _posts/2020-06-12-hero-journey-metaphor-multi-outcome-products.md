excerpt:
  The Hero's Journey is this story-telling pattern where the hero overcomes a struggle. Your product aims to resolve a struggle, but what you might be missing is how you can catch and serve those for whom your product is not yet a fit, and offer to help on their Journey anyway.

In the [previous article, we looked at logology.co][logology], an AI-powered, self-serve logo-selection app.

My main feedback to the app's creators was to **turn the product into a multi-outcome offering**.

> The biggest opportunity with logology is that it offers only one product.

1. Because there's a push-back when answering the branding questionnaire, tempting visitors to abort the process, I recommend **having an option to take the questionnaire with them**. A downloadable PDF would be a **secondary product**.
2. Because there's a mixture of high-trust and potential let-down when no logo presented fits the bill, there's a missed opportunity to **invite the visitor to hire the designer directly**. Not an upsell, but a way to serve the user who wants to keep going in the process and isn't worried about price.

In a [follow-up discussion][thread] with one of the developers, I expanded on my feedback (emphasis added):

[thread]: https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/logology-co-the-logo-maker-for-design-lovers/6952/4?u=pascallaliberte

> The success of logology right now is bound to a binary success metric: they have or have not obtained a logo.
> 
> My suggestion is to make it a multi-finish-line product **because of the mini-struggles that occur that the super-attractive journey logology has laid out ahead for the visitor**.

## The Hero's Journey

Writing that follow-up reminded me of the Hero's Journey metaphor, which fits well with the [struggle-centric approach][struggle] I've been advocating, which is also central to the [Jobs-to-be-done theory of buyer behavior][jtbd-intro].

[struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}
[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

In short, the Hero's Journey is a story-telling pattern where the protagonist (the main character):

1. Is confronted with an obstacle or a difficulty that grows into a struggle;
1. Sets out to find a way to fix that struggle;
1. Through a series of new circumstances **(along the journey)** is presented with new choices that make the old ways no longer tenable, forcing her to choose;
1. Through adversity and tenacity, the protagonist pushes through the switch to the new reality, coming back to her reality forever changed, a beacon of triumph for others to witness.

## Catching Obstacles Your Product Creates

All products of consequence, all products or services [proposing a better way forward][better-way], have to [address a struggle that's hard enough][struggle] for the buyer to say no to the old way, and yes to the new way. **No struggle, no product.**

[better-way]: {% post_url 2019-12-13-four-ways-to-say-theres-a-better-way %}

And yet! Not everyone will choose to go forward. That's because **along the journey**, anxieties will surely manifest themselves. Too high a price. [Too many features][feature-anxiety].

[feature-anxiety]: {% post_url 2019-02-15-when-a-feature-is-not-a-feature %}

Those anxieties will surely make the buyer revert back to ["I'll just" statements][non-consumption], to default down to the mish-mash of solutions the person is already using.

[non-consumption]: {% post_url 2018-12-17-universal-competitor %}

**Your product (your service) will be, for some, an obstacle on their progress.**

This, to me, is the opportunity too many products fail to take advantage of.

Like [logology][logology], most products present a single outcome.

Instead, why not **morph your product into a multi-outcome offering**?

* When your product creates an obstacle, why not offer a sub-product to help the person **get moving on the progress they seek to make**? A PDF they can take with them for a lower price. Or maybe a video course. Or maybe a subscription to [your newsletter, which in itself should address a job-to-be-done][newsletter-jtbd];
* At the point in your landing page where **you suspect some people will be choosing to "do it themselves"**, why not show them how to go about doing that? That might actually accentuate a different struggle ("I don't have time to learn all this") and put them back on track on their main journey;
* When your product is being hired but doesn't completely solve the job-to-be-done, why not offer more? Offer to put them in touch with a community, offer some custom services, or confidently suggest a competitor.

[newsletter-jtbd]: {% post_url 2019-01-17-product-and-newsletter-and-professional-services %}

What will you create when you help a person via this multi-outcome approach?

**You'll create more heros.** More heros who will come back to their reality, changed, beacons of triumph for others to witness.

Stay Sharp!
