excerpt:
  Here's a roundup of articles, a twitter thread and a podcast I found this week answering about freelancing in a recession. "Be an investment, not an expense". Good luck!

* "Are things going to be okay?"
* "I need new clients, like now."
* "Should I re-positioning, adjusting my service offerings?"
* "Should I lower my prices?"

## "You Are Going to Be Spectacular"

Blair Enns, from Win Without Pitching, wrote a piece titled:

[**Three Steps to Surviving and Thriving in a Crisis**][blair]

[blair]: https://www.winwithoutpitching.com/three-steps-to-surviving-and-thriving-in-a-crisis/

* The answer is No, you are not going to be okay. You are going to be spectacular. _(Note: that's because Blair teaches agencies how to make a difference to their clients, and these times are when this approach pays off.)_
* It's a fantastic time to be leading, to lean on what you've been teaching and to offer a calm presence.
* Innovate on payment terms to build trust and help your clients smooth out the next few months. Offer discounts on advance payments.
* Be open to new business models, explore adjacencies.
* Get cheap credit.

## Forget Adjusting Your Business, Get a Client This Week

Robert Williams of Folyo wrote this one-tip-per-day plan for kicking ass this next week:

[**How to Get High-Paying Web Design Clients Fast – Like This Week**][folyo]

[folyo]: https://folyo.me/blog/how-to-get-web-design-clients-fast/

1. Email past clients right away
2. DM someone on that Slack community who posts a freelancer contract opportunity
3. Follow-up on old job applications by sending a thoughtful email
4. Referrals: ask some, give some too
5. On LinkedIn, email people who post RFPs

## Developers: Learn in Public

Swyx (hot site design!) spells out the impact to developers in this piece:

[**The Coronavirus Recession and What it Means for Developers**][swyx]

[swyx]: https://www.swyx.io/writing/coronavirus-recession/

* Freelance developers can expect to see clients taking longer to respond, get beaten magically by more competitive offers or have shorter contracts
* Learn in Public: write, publish, start a newsletter. You'll learn faster.
* Companies will be weary to try new tech, favouring the tried and true.
* As a finance guy turned developer, he explains why recession "risks are real".

## In 2008, Amy Hoy had LOTS of Work by Executing What CEOs Loved

Amy Hoy, from Stacking the Bricks, shared this on twitter:

[**Thread from Amy Hoy About Her Lessons from the 2008-2009 Recession**][amy]

[amy]: https://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/1233174690274766848

* She was neither the most dispensable nor the highest-priced
* She executed what CEOs loved
* To do great in a downturn, be an investment, not an expense
* Run lean too, and you'll do great

## The Best Path Forward Is to Help Your Clients

Jonathan Stark and Rochelle Moulton have this podcast called "The Business of Authority". This episode is great:

[**Dealing With Chaos**][podcast] -- ([Overcast][overcast])

[podcast]: https://thebusinessofauthority.com/episodes/dealing-with-chaos
[overcast]: https://overcast.fm/+Ldan_-SsU

* Take whatever you do, what you're good at, and apply it to this new reality. The other option is to close down, only think about yourself.
* You might as well help your clients move forward, even if there's no obvious way to get paid doing it.
* How would you want your audience to act? Help lead your group in that direction, to demonstrate how to act.
* Just do the next right thing (-- Frozen 2)
* You've got a service business, so _serve_.
