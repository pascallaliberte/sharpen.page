excerpt:
  Akord does document sharing for those who don't trust the mainstream providers and their lack of end-to-end encryption. The author asked for feedback on his headlines. Here's my take.
---

[Akord][akord] is a startup that does document sharing. Its main angle: **unlike Dropbox, Google Drive and the other mainstream providers, Akord does end-to-end encryption of the documents**. Pascal (no relation), who works on Akord, [asked for feedback on the headlines he was considering][thread].

## How Would You Rewrite These Headings?

Here are some more that Pascal was considering:

* **Forget about getting hacked**<br> Manage your files and send messages with end-to-end encryption from within the security of Akord's data rooms.
* **Do you know who encrypts your data?**<br> Manage your files and send messages with end-to-end encryption from within the security of Akord's data rooms.
* **Own your data.**<br> Confidently store and share files and messages in Akord's data rooms. You own the keys to the end-to-end encryption, so even we can't see your data. _(Note: There's some good stuff here)_
* **Secure data rooms for privacy-focused collaboration.**<br> Confidently store and share files and messages protected by end-to-end encryption.

It's tricky to get the main headline right.

* Make it clear
* Maybe make it clever
* Keep it short
* Make every word count

Those might be some good benchmarks to use for judging a headline, but I rely on something more fundamental: **how do you know a headline will connect with a visitor?**

## Struggle-First Headlines

I've written about the [Struggle-First copywriting style](/struggle-first) before. It's useful especially [when your audience doesn't have a pre-established mindset](/struggle-first/vs-features-benefits/) about your product yet.

The trick: connect not so much with their [aspiration][level-3-sharpening] (here's what you'll get), but more **with what they're going through right before coming to the site** (this is what you're going through, correct?)

[level-3-sharpening]: {% post_url 2020-01-17-level-3-sharpening-so-you-can-rely-less-on-sales %}

Here's a struggle-first headline that could work:

* **You don't trust the mainstream document-sharing services**<br> Dropbox, Box, Google Drive: you know they don't do end-to-end encryption. We do. And you own the keys, not us.

**This goes straight to the core of the reason** they'd even bother visiting a derivative product like Akord.

## "When" Statements

To get even more inside the mind of the visitor, it pays to imagine some ["when" statements][try-when], like these:

[try-when]: {% post_url 2019-02-21-try-when %}

* **When** I'm trying to share documents for a multi-week project but without wavering from my beliefs about cryptography...
* **When** I've recently started a new company and I'm hiring my first collaborator...
* **When** I see yet another data breach in the news...

One of them will be a good suitor for the main headline. [Maybe you can tap into all of them on your page][just-one-struggle], using different headlines.

[just-one-struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-20-focus-on-just-one-struggle %}

## More than One Headline: "I feel understood"

Imagine the visitor being presented by one of these headlines at the top...

* **You don't trust the mainstream document-sharing services**<br> Dropbox, Box, Google Drive: you know they don't do end-to-end encryption. We do. You own the keys.

They react by feeling, "yes, that's true". _They scroll_.

Then they're presented with another headline:

* **Maybe you just started a company, or even just a new project**. Start the team or project with proper encryption. We know cryptography. You own the keys to your data room. Collaborate on your documents with peace of mind.

"Exactly". _They scroll some more_.

* **You know that every provider storing your documents will eventually get hacked.** Unless they can't see your documents. That's where we come in. We can't see any of your documents. You own the keys.

"I feel understood!". "Where can I learn more?"

Using this build-up of struggle-first headlines gets the right kind of visitor to stay, and they wrong kind of visitor to leave.

## Then Create a Page That _Flows_

Then you can address all of the other elements that matter on a landing page, like [reducing anxieties][reduce-anxieties], tending to the [mental back-and-forth going on in the mind of your visitor][four-forces], and knowing what they'll revert to so you can end the page with an alternative offering from you (that might be lower anxiety, [like a how-to document][heros-journey]) for those who were about to leave.

[Get the order right][best-order] by having each section build on top of the previous section's momentum, and you'll get people talking with excitement and buying with confidence.

[reduce-anxieties]: {% post_url 2020-10-30-to-add-appeal-first-reduce-anxieties %}
[four-forces]: {% post_url 2018-12-06-forces-of-progress-in-purchase-decision %}
[heros-journey]: {% post_url 2020-06-12-hero-journey-metaphor-multi-outcome-products %}
[best-order]: {% post_url 2020-04-17-best-order-of-elements-on-landing-page %}

## But Will the Product Sell?

This is a huge question. [Akord will probably fail][your-product-will-fail]. The buyer momentum, it's not there.

* I'm looking for a strong struggle. It's not there.
* I'm looking for more attraction than anxieties. It's not there.
* I'm looking for an overal equation of (struggle + attraction > anxieties + "I'll just alternatives"). "I'll just do whatever the other people I'm working prefers to use". "I'll just continue encrypting documents by hand".

I'm not seeing a home run here, and products like these need a home-run when it comes to [buyer momentum][your-product-will-fail].

I wrote an article on my advice for [pushing through when your product might fail][push-through]. In particular, maybe Akord could concentrate on a way sharper "when" statement that happens way more often (but would normally appear to be a [worse product][worse-product]), build trust, and in time offer the user base an offering that's a notch up. Maybe. One thing Akord has going for it is the collaboration aspect creates built-in word-of-mouth. Let's wish Pascal (no relation) the best of luck!

[push-through]: {% post_url 2020-11-13-your-product-might-push-through-with-these-perspectives %}
[worse-product]: {% post_url 2020-10-23-make-a-worse-product-to-save-it %}

Stay Sharp!
