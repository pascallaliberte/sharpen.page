excerpt:
  You're reading some conflicting advice. Start by building an audience or no? Listen to your customers or ignore product research? Via Negativa, using a negative lens, might cut to the basics a little better. Let's try some inverse product advice.
---

You've been keeping tabs on the advice about building a product. And, well, something doesn't feel right.

* Some say you should build an audience first.
* Some say building an audience first is great for ebooks and online courses, but not for SaaS products.
* Some say you should find a niche.
* Some say you should go for a mature market with competitors.
* Some say you should [find a hard struggle with lots of momentum toward switching away from the old and toward the new][struggle]. _(I'm the one telling you that one.)_
* Some say you should use this framework or that framework.
* Some say you should listen to your customers.
* Some say you should mostly ignore your customers.
* Some say you should build a product for others first.
* Some say you should build a product for yourself first.

Some say "it depends" and then the discussion grows and grows.

And you're left dissatisfied, awashed in advice.

The thing is, **people who give advice mean well.** There's an impending economic collapse. There's an urgency for all of us to build some financial security. We all want to help.

But all advice is, eventually, incomplete. Every metaphor has a hole.

In some sense, all statements are wrong.

But at the very least, we can say this: **_positive_ statements are more susceptible to being wrong.**

## "Via Negativa"

I've been reading _Antifragile_ from Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In it, he shows how _Via Negativa_, stating things in the negative, is a more robust lens to use for finding the truth.

Taleb makes the case that it's better to give negative advice than to give positive advice. **It's more robust to see things through the negative than through the positive.**

Knowledge that's built up through positive statements becomes more fragile the more positive statements are added. Knowledge that's expressed through negative statements stands the test of time.

Example:

> Avoid taking advice from people who don't stand to lose anything from the advice they're giving.

...is more robust than...

> Read advice from a variety of sources.

Using _Via Negativa_, let's rewrite, in the negative, some of the most common product advice.

## Inverse Product Advice (Let's Start a List)

Should we start by building an audience or no? **Well, we don't know. Some built an audience first. Some announced a product and got a ton of word of mouth.** 

Should we enter a mature market or should we start a new product category? **Who knows? Some have created entirely new product categories. Some have found a space in a market with competitors. Some were first to market. Some became the best of a market.**

But what we can say for sure:

> Avoid building a product **if it's not somehow going to be worth your efforts**.

Also:

> Don't attempt a product **if it'll ruin you**.

Or more related to the audience/product category debate:

> Don't make a product that will take **a lot of effort to find demand for it**.

And how about this one:

> Avoid **relying too much on persuasion** to sell your products.

And this last one:

> Avoid building a product **that nobody is going to want to use**.

And on finding out what people want:

> Don't listen to what customers say **when they're making stuff up**.

Those negative statements sound obvious. Avoiding the worst sounds simplistic.

And yet, you're probably going to build a product no matter what people tell you. You're probably going to cling to your pre-determined ideas and ignore people's advice.

But I bet you're glad you're getting those reminders, aren't you?

Stay Sharp.
