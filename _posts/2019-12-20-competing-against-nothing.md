In the book [_Competing Against Luck_][book], Clayton Christensen makes the case for a special kind of product: a product which competes, as Clayton says, **against "nothing"**.

**What does that mean, exactly?** It does not mean that the product has no competitor. It means something else.

[book]: https://www.competingagainstluck.com

To serve as an example, here's [SendHoney][sendhoney]. It competes against "nothing".

[![SendHoney is a product which competes against 'nothing'](/assets/images/posts/2019-12-20-competing-against-nothing-01.jpg)][sendhoney]
{: .img-zoom }

SendHoney gets flowers delivered to people you love. Set it and forget it. That's what it does.

**Does it mean that SendHoney has no competitor?** You _could_ say there are other similar services. There might be flower shops who allow booking a flower delivery far in advance.

But this product isn't just offering a service. It's offering a promise: "you be the hero".

## The Struggles: _When_ You'd _Even Care_ To Be that Kind of Hero

As we've covered, the first rule for a product (or a service) to exist is this: [there needs to be a struggling moment that's strong enough][struggle] to propel someone to get off their chair and do something about it.

[struggle]: {% post_url 2019-09-06-hard-struggle-required %}

So [let's use the word "when"][try-when] to find those struggling moments, using it in this template:

[try-when]: {% post_url 2019-02-21-try-when %}

* "**When I'm** [struggle being experienced], **I want to** [next step I'm considering] **so I can** [outcome desired]."

Let's find **situations that pinch just enough** to make someone seek out a service like SendHoney:

1. When I've been away from home for months, and **my connection with my spouse is at the point that it's a little shaky**, I want to find a way to send flowers regularly so I can demonstrate that I'm invested in the relationship.
2. **When I hear that my mother is going through a rough time with her health**, I want to find a way to send her something special on a regular basis so I can make sure she feels I'm with her.
3. **When I realize that my daughter will soon be away from home for college**, I want to plan something special in her first few weeks and on special moments in her first year so I can make sure she feels we're rooting for her.

In _those_ situations, where would someone turn to get those [jobs][jtbd-intro] done?

[jtbd-intro]: {% post_url 2018-11-29-intro-to-jobs-to-be-done-through-examples %}

* **I could search the web and find nearby flower shops** that will commit to organizing flower deliveries on certain dates. That might be easy. It might take calling a few flower shops before I find one that will offer that service. **And even then, there will be the anxiety of not knowing if they'll respect their commitment, whether I have to pay all of it up front, choosing which flowers to send for which event, etc.**<br>_It's complicated_, and so...
* **I could call folks I know that are closer to my loved one** and delegate that task to them. But then you're asking for a commitment for a service. You get mental pushback at the thought of adding a burden on someone else, **of creating an inconvenience for them**.<br>Again, _it's complicated_, which is why...
* **I'll likely default back to doing something simple myself**, like setting reminders before certain dates and committing to follow through. **But then I'm trusting "future me" to have the head space** to, each time, call the flower shop or whatever other delivery service, set an appointment or make an order.<br>_Doing it myself seems complicated_.

Seeing as all the other likely next steps _for those specific situations_ are getting a little too complicated, **what am I likely to choose to do?**

**I'm likely to choose to do _nothing_.** To drop it. To put it off.

That's what competing against "nothing" is about.

Most products have this universal competitor. It's what commonly called [non-consumption][non-consumption].

[non-consumption]: {% post_url 2018-12-17-universal-competitor %}

Non-consumption means this: people choose to do nothing, or people choose to do it themselves. **People choose to not change anything about their situation, _despite_ the struggle**, because there just isn't a good option that's available.

Found an area with a hard struggle with situations where potential buyers forfeit back to non-consumption?

Found a pinch that's competing against "nothing"?

**You might be onto something.**

Stay Sharp!
