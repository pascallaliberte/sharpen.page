Here's a free resource for helping you get into the mind of buyers. These articles are organized by category (you can also [list articles by latest to oldest here](/articles/latest/)), and here's a quick breakdown:

* **For some of the foundations of buyer psychology**, you'll want to start with [Jobs-To-Be-Done Basics](#jtbd-basics).
* **If you're getting cancellations**, surprising kinds of customers, or you're just starting out in a new niche, check out articles on [Churn, Buyer Research and Purchase Interviews](#research).
* **With strong empathy for your buyers**, you have a base for [Validating and Discerning](#discerning) product or feature ideas. Good theory helps predict behaviour.
* **To communicate your product to potential buyers**, check out articles on [Copywriting](#copywriting). You should consider creating [Struggle-First Landing Pages](#struggle-first) for your product or service, especially when buyers don't have an established mindset about your solution to their problem. There's a bunch of articles showcasing some [Example Sites](#showcase) too.
* **When it's time to tweak your products and your marketing**, there's a whole section on [Optimizing & A/B Testing](#optimize)
* **Most of you starting** should really consider using buyer psychology with [Consulting and Freelancing](#consulting), offering productized services, understanding the real progress your clients are hoping to make. Jobs-to-be-done, after all, is a set of fractal tools that work both with the big and the small. That's how I started.
