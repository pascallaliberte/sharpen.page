Here's a free resource for helping you get into the mind of buyers. These articles are organized by category (you can also [list articles by latest to oldest here](/articles/latest/)), and here's a quick breakdown:

* **For some of the foundations of buyer psychology**, you'll want to start with [Jobs-To-Be-Done Basics](#jtbd-basics), and then maybe look into [Buyer Research and Purchase Interviews](#research).
* **With strong empathy for your buyers**, you can disqualify some ideas, and sort of predict whather your product will work. Check out the articles on [Validating and Discerning](#discerning).
* **To communicate your product to potential buyers**, check out articles on [Copywriting](#copywriting). I also think you should strongly consider creating [Struggle-First Landing Pages](struggle-first) for your product or service. A bunch of articles showcasing some [Example Sites](#showcase) too.
* **When it's time to tweak your products and your marketing**, there's a whole section on [Optimizing & A/B Testing](#optimize)
* **Most of you starting** should really consider using buyer psychology with [Consulting and Freelancing](#consulting), offering productized services, understanding the real progress your clients are hoping to make. Jobs-to-be-done, after all, is a set of fractal tools that work both with the big and the small. That's how I started.
