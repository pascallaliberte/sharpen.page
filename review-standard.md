## Standard Layout? Standard Review.

You got a version of your product's landing page. You know, standard layout:

1. Hero
1. Features
1. Benefits/How it works/Testimonials
1. Signup/Pricing
{: .page-structure }

_(**This will also work:** Hero, something else, Features, something else, Benefits/How it works/Testimonials, something else, Signup/Pricing.)_

_Don't have a landing page yet? **A mockup will work too**. That's right, you'll be able to upload the picture into the video. Or if you want, I'll have some sample landing pages you can load up while you create yours._

If your landing page fits that layout, **learn the things that nobody's telling you you need to improve**. I know, big claim, but I'm serious. People are giving you useless advice.

Instead, I'm going to teach you to **see/notice/understand** the mental back-and-forth the visitor is probably going through when visiting your new page.

## It's just ~~37$~~ _$29!_ That's Because It's Pre-Recorded.

[{% include svg/credit-card.svg.html %} Pre-order the Video][purchase]{: .cta-btn }  
**Provide your site URL. Upload a mockup.  
Press Play. Replay as often as you like.  
Change the URL as often as you like.**

Everyone who purchases this video review gets the same "video". And you'll see, **if your site has that standard, popular layout**, you'll see where your page can be improved.

_Your landing page,  
center stage!_
{: .punchy-copy }

Add your landing page on the left, my face and my "teaching tool" will be on the right. Press play. Try it above to give you an idea.

## Know Whether Your Landing Page Works,<br>Before You Show it To People.

That's my promise. This is how I'll do that:

## You'll Leave with a New Lens on How Visitors Experience Your Landing Page

After you watch the video, you'll have:

* **Learned about the lens of the Jobs-to-be-done Forces of Progress**, and how your visitor will experience your site, their **mental back and forth** in determining whether to give your product a shot or not. You won't be able to unlearn it, and because it'll be your site, you'll be able to **self-judge your site as if you're a visitor**;
* **Learned what you can do to punch up the top of your landing page** so your visitors say "I feel understood" and "I'm in the right spot";
* **Learned about feature anxiety** and how to communicate just the features that'll help your visitor advance on their job-to-be-done;
* **Helped you decide whether you're charging the right amount for your product**, and whether a "Sign up for free" really does the job for your product's landing page;
* **Learned about making a page that flows**, where from section to section, the momentum builds up;
* **Got help spotting one or two holes** in your landing page;
* **Got more confidence to know whether your product has a shot at going further**, based on this new lens.

_All in a single review.  
Replay after a tweak or two._
{: .punchy-copy }

## "You can't deliver on all that with the same video for everybody using a standard layout"

_Watch me_. That's because in my video, I'm talking about subjects that **nobody's talking about**:

* Nobody's talking about the **progression of the mental back-and-forth a visitor has when experiencing the site**, but my video will;
* Nobody's talking about **crafting your site for situations causing people to switch**, but my video will;
* Nobody's talking about **the role that the Forces of Progress plays** in knowing whether the different parts of a landing page (listed above) work or not, but my video will;
* Nobody's talking about the **importance of helping your visitor make some progress on a struggle**, even if that means not converting everyone to your main product, and the power to rescue those that were about to leave anyway, your biggest opportunity for the bottom of your page, but my video will.

<div class="review-standard-cta" markdown="block">
[All right, take me to the pre-order page][purchase]{: .cta-btn }
</div>

And I won't just tell you theories. You'll see your own site on display while I tell you what's going on in the visitor's mind. **No need to connect the dots. You'll _feel_ the problems in your page as I run through the video.**

_Before that feature list grows in size  
View it through the visitor's own eyes._
{: .punchy-copy }

And besides, the "standard layout" assumes you just need to find a clever title, follow a template, add features and benefits, and you're done. You know that doesn't cut it. I'll show you what will cut it. I'll go deep with stuff you can use to **judge your own work**.

## Maybe This Is Your Situation...

* Maybe you've tried **asking for feedback on IndieHackers or Reddit**. The feedback you got was the UX-y type: change fonts, tweak graphics, or people telling you your page has too much text (it probably doesn't). Stuff like that. Hasn't been that helpful.
* Maybe you've been avoiding asking for feedback **because you don't know if it's ready yet**.
* Maybe you're not sure the advice you're getting **will make a different for _your_ visitors**.
* Maybe **you'd like to veer from the standard layout**, but you're not sure you should.

The thing is, most people who give you feedback use the wrong part of their brain. They use the creative part of their brain to give you feedback, **whereas your visitors are coming to your site using their problem-solving part of their brain**. They don't care about your fonts or your graphics or your turn of phrases. They don't care that you removed "friction".

**Your visitors care about making progress on the thing they want to make progress on.** I'll help you see your page through that _lens_.

## Now Accepting Pre-orders

The video is coming soon.

And because you'll have been one of the early customers, I'll send you a quick email commenting on your site: a word of encouragement, a note on something I notice, something helpful.

## Or Purchase a Custom Review<br> (but that's More Expensive)

I also offer a custom [/review](/review) service. This is a custom video review of your site, where I go in-depth with the struggle your product helps solve, and then I go through the mental back-and-forth of the visitors coming to your site who want progress on that struggle.

**And if that's not the right time**, consider checking out my [/articles](/articles) and [/diy](/diy) section for things you can learn on your own. Make that landing page work!

Hope that helps.

Stay sharp.
