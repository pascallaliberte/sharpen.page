Hi, I'm Pascal Laliberté, and I'm here to help _you, fellow software devs_, **develop an intuition on what goes on inside the mind of a buyer**.
{: .intro }

## You've Been Posing Yourself These Questions:

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "What makes someone **decide to buy** a product?"

</div>

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "**How come I just bought** a $150 UI kit with my own money?"

</div>

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "Is there a way to shape my products and services so that they help someone exchange money and attention for my solution? That is, **in a way I'll be okay with?**"

</div>

## Here's My Offer:

* **One article per week**, sent on Friday PM (Eastern time), from my archive of articles on buyer psychology, over ten weeks.
* **An async coach, for free**. Because I'm just starting this offering, you get access to back and forth a little bit with me each week over email, gratis.
* **A list tailored to you, week by week**. From our back and forth, I'll be choosing the next right article to help with your progress. I can cover the basics, I can go deeper on product or freelancing or copywriting. Up to you. Maybe I'll officialize a list later on, but if you sign up now, you get something tailored.
* **An offer, only at the end, to stay on the list**. But that's up to you. You're not signing up to anything else.

"Yep, I'm game". To sign up, simply...

## Topics Covered in my Articles

I'll craft a list that touches on some of these topics:

* The **Jobs-to-be-done theory** of buyer behavior...
* What your product **competes** with...
* How **price** is just one of many hesitations...
* How people just want to make progress, and **your job is just to help them**...
* How to **predict when it's just not the right time** to be selling...
* How to write **landing page copy** that makes people say "I feel understood!"...
* How to choose **which type of landing page layout** to use (struggle-first vs features and benefits)...
* How to **_not_ be sales-y**...
* How to **understand people's struggles**...

**And specifically for freelancers, consultants and current employees:**

* How to sell your **ideas**...
* How to publish a constellation of **struggle-solvers** that point to you...
* How **discouraging your client leads** from hiring you helps get to the value...

## By the End, You Will...

Before we're done together, you will be celebrating that you'll have:

* Discovered a couple new lenses about how people buy
* Advanced on clarifying one of your upcoming projects, how you'll be able to make it work
* Jogged some new ideas on what you could sell
* Gotten feedback from me on your product ideas

## Very Soon, You Will Sell Something New

* You will sell **an idea**, because you'll know when and when not to propose it
* You will sell **a new service** at a new price
* You will know how to sell **a new product idea**
* **You will know how to buy** what others are selling, because you'll know what progress you're trying to make yourself

## Questions and Answers

### Q: Why are you offering this level of personalization for free?

A: I'm only going to run it for free for a period of time, then I might stop the offer, charge a fee for it ($79?), or make it automated (not tailored, unlike this version is).

The exciting thing for me is this: I get to have immediate feedback on your progress, week to week. I originally ran it with a friend, and I loved the back and forth.

### Q: Are you just going to send me manual emails each week?

A: Yes, I'll be writing manual emails. No bulk sendouts for now. I'll also be asking follow-up questions from you, what you're working on, what your reactions are, whether you're reading any other books at the same time, stuff like that.

### Q: Do you have books to recommend reading at the same time?

A: I do. I recommend you start with one of these two books, and they'll pair super well with the articles:

* [Competing Against Luck][competing-against-luck] by Clayton Christensen
* [Demand-Side Sales 101][demand-side-sales] by Bob Moesta

### Q: I see you offer bigger packages on the home page, and they're mostly for existing product owners. Do you have anything else for those who are pre-product?

A: I've sold my services to consultants in the past, to help productize their services, creating "value ladders". If that's interesting to you, send me a note.
