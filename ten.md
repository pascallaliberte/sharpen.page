Hi, I'm Pascal Lalibert√©, and I'm here to help _you, fellow software devs_, **develop an intuition on what goes on inside the mind of a buyer**.

You've been posing yourself these questions:

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "What makes someone **decide to buy** a product?"

</div>

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "**How come I just bought** a $150 UI kit with my own money?"

</div>

<div class="situation-quotes" markdown="1">

> "Is there a way to shape my products and services so that they help someone exchange money and attention for my solution? That is, **in a way I'll be okay with?**"

</div>

I'm offering you this:

* **One article per week**, sent on Friday PM (Eastern time), from my archive of articles on buyer psychology, over ten weeks.
* **An async coach, for free**. Because I'm just starting this offering, you get access to back and forth a little bit with me each week over email, gratis.
* **A list tailored to you, week by week**. From our back and forth, I'll be choosing the next right article to help with your progress. I can cover the basics, I can go deeper on product or freelancing or copywriting. Up to you. Maybe I'll officialize a list later on, but if you sign up now, you get something tailored.
* **An offer, only at the end, to stay on the list**. But that's up to you. You're not signed up to anything else.

"Yep, I'm game". To sign up, simply...
